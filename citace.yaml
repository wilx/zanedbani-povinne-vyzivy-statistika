  title: Politické zastoupení žen

  keyword: deskriptivní a substantivní reprezentace, koncept kritické masy, gender, genderové stereotypy, genderová nerovnost, genderová politická kultura, ženy v politických stranách, descriprive and substantive political representation, concept of critical mass, gender, gender stereotypes, gender inequality, gender political culture, women in political parties
  abstract: 'Diplomová práce na téma politické reprezentace žen se zabývá
    především analýzou příčin nízkého zastoupení žen v politice. Teoretický
    rámec práce postihuje základní koncepty, kterými jsou především
    substantivní a deskriptivní reprezentace a koncept kritické masy. Práce
    blíže definuje institucionální a společensko-kulturní bariéry vstupu žen
    do politiky. Analýza se soustředí na zastoupení žen v České republice z
    hlediska deskriptivní reprezentace, tedy především numerického zastoupení
    žen ve volených orgánech na všech úrovních samosprávy, tzn. v Poslanecké
    sněmovně, Senátu, krajských a obecních zastupitelstvech. Pro tuto studii
    jsou rovinou analýzy zvoleny jednotlivé parlamentní strany ? ODS, ČSSD,
    KSČM, KDU-ČSL a SZ. Jsou zkoumány z pohledu zastoupení žen v rámci
    členské základy, stranických orgánů, kandidátních listin a zvolených
    zastupitelů. V práci není opomenut ani základní přístup jednotlivých
    politických stran k pozitivním opatřením, nejčastěji kvótám, a existence
    takovýchto opatření v rámci strany. Výsledky diplomové práce potvrzují,
    že politické strany jsou klíčovými aktéry v procesu navyšování ženské
    politické participace. Genderová politická kultura ani institucionální
    nastavení českých politických stran je až na výjimky pro ženy
    nepříznivé. Nic na tom nemění ani fakt, že v rámci jednotlivých stran
    fungují ženské frakce. K větší otevřenosti politických stran je nutné
    rozšířit veřejnou debatu na širší společenské okruhy a výrazněji
    zainteresovat také jednotlivé státní subjekty, které disponují
    "donucovacími" nástroji ve směru k politickým stranám.'

  abstract: 'The report includes calculations for each Member State of the proposed
    common indicators of migrant integration based on data currently available from
    the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), the European Union Statistics
    on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), Eurostat’s migration statistics as
    well as the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The
    indicators apply to four policy areas: employment, education, social inclusion
    and active citizenship.The report consists of methodological notes, a synthetic
    description of the results and a tabular part with calculations of indicators.
    To maximise the added value of the indicators, the information for different target
    populations has been provided for broad groups of country of birth and citizenship,
    different age groups and gender.'

  title: Důvody pro (ne)ohlášení trestného činu znásilnění
    z pohledu oběti
  publisher: Masarykova univerzita, Fakulta sociálních studií
  publisher-place: Brno
  URL: http://is.muni.cz/th/109597/fss_b/
  abstract: 'Práce se zabývá důvody, které vedou ženy k ohlášení nebo
     neohlášení znásilnění. V teoretické části práce se autorka věnuje
     otázce, co je to znásilnění, psychologii oběti a viktimizaci ve vztahu k obětem znásilnění. Dále se také zabývá mýty a stereotypy spojenými se
     znásilněním a v závěru teoretické části také konkrétními důvody
     neohlášení a ohlášení znásilnění dle dosavadních studií a výzkumů. Práce
     je zaměřena na ženy, které se staly obětí znásilnění, resp. samy se
     vnímají jako oběť znásilnění. Výzkumu se zúčastnilo 111 žen ve věku
     16-54 let. Tyto ženy měly zkušenost s formami sexuálního násilí od
     osahávání až po dokonaný pohlavní styk, orální nebo anální sex, případně
     i kombinaci těchto druhů sexuálního násilí. Analýza získaných dat byla
     prováděna metodou konceptuální obsahové analýzy. Výzkumem bylo zjištěno,
     že nejčastějšími důvody vedoucími k neohlášení znásilnění jsou pocity
     viny oběti, nedůvěra vůči orgánům činným v trestním řízení, strach z pachatele a pocity studu a ponížení oběti. Jako nejčastější důvody
     vedoucí k ohlášení znásilnění byly zjištěny přání potrestat pachatele,
     snaha zabránit dalším útokům a způsob vyrovnání se oběti s tímto
     činem. Výzkum přináší také zjištění o okolnostech znásilnění, které
     mohou mít na ohlášení nebo neohlášení znásilnění vliv. Jedná se o omluvy
     nebo výhružky ze strany pachatele, smírná gesta nebo komunikaci či
     intimní kontakt oběti a pachatele bezprostředně před znásilněním. V diskuzi autorka propojuje výsledky výzkumu s teoretickými koncepty a
     výzkumy a navrhuje možná témata dalších výzkumů.'

  title: On the viability of conspiratorial beliefs
  container-title: PLoS ONE
  publisher: Public Library of Science
  page: 'e0147905'
  volume: '11'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to believe that
    events and power relations are secretly manipulated by certain clandestine groups
    and organisations. Many of these ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable,
    lacking in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains high.
    Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of medical and scientific
    findings can be hampered by such narratives, which can create the impression of
    doubt or disagreement in areas where the science is well established. Conversely,
    historical examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for
    people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious assertions. In this work,
    we establish a simple mathematical model for conspiracies involving multiple actors
    with time, which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters
    for the model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals, and the
    factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are explored. The model is
    also used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial
    beliefs; these are namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is
    a hoax, vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being suppressed
    by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict that intrinsic failure
    would be imminent even with the most generous estimates for the secret-keeping
    ability of active participants—the results of this model suggest that large conspiracies
    (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and prone to failure. The theory presented
    here might be useful in counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences
    of bogus and anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions
    under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible.

  abstract: 'A new survey report looks at attitudes among Muslims in 39 countries on a wide range of topics, from science to sharia, polygamy to popular culture. The survey finds that overwhelming percentages of Muslims in many countries want Islamic law to be the official law of their land, but there is also widespread support for democracy and religious freedom.'

  title: Complete genes may pass from food to human blood
  container-title: PLoS ONE
  publisher: Public Library of Science
  page: 'e69805'
  volume: '8'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: 'Our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated
    from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm
    large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory
    system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small
    constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by
    a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through
    the circulation system. Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples
    from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments
    which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through
    an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples
    the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant
    DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the
    plasma samples while non-plasma (cord blood) control sample was found to be free
    of plant DNA.'

  title: 'Muslim integration into western cultures: Between origins and destinations'
  title-short: Muslim integration into western cultures
  publisher: John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University
  abstract: 'To what extent do migrants carry their culture with them, and to
    what extent do they acquire the culture of their new home? The answer not
    only has important political implications; it also helps us understand
    the extent to which basic cultural values are enduring or malleable; and
    whether cultural values are traits of individuals or are attributes of a
    given society. Part I considers theories about the impact of growing
    social diversity in Western nations. We classify two categories of
    society: ORIGINS (defined as Islamic Countries of Origin for Muslim
    migrants, including twenty nations with plurality Muslim populations) and
    DESTINATIONS (defined as Western Countries of Destination for Muslim
    migrants, including twenty-two OECD member states with Protestant or
    Roman Catholic majority populations). Using this framework, we
    demonstrate that on average, the basic social values of Muslim migrants
    fall roughly mid-way between those prevailing in their country of origin
    and their country of destination. We conclude that Muslim migrants do not
    move to Western countries with rigidly fixed attitudes; instead, they
    gradually absorb much of the host culture, as assimilation theories
    suggest.'

Nejkřiklavější z nich je pravděpodobně skutečnost, že místo toho, aby se soud a sociálka po rozchodu rodičů snažily otce do péče o dítě maximálně zapojit, naopak ho ze života dítěte zcela cíleně a systémově vytlačují. O těchto skutečnostech opět nejlépe vypovídají statistiky. Více než 90 % dětí je po rozvodu nebo rozchodu rodičů svěřováno do výlučné péče matky. Pouze 3 - 4 % dětí jsou svěřovány do střídavé nebo společné péče rodičů, a to prakticky pouze v případě, kdy se na ní rodiče dohodli a soud tak vlastně vůbec nepotřebují.'

    tenure track
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '5360-5365'
  volume: '112'
  issue: '17'
  abstract: National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted
    on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering,
    economics, and psychology at 371 universities/colleges from 50 US states and the
    District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative
    summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track
    assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children,
    married with children). Applicants’ profiles were systematically varied to disguise
    identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across
    faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically
    qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty
    of both genders across both math-intensive and non–math-intensive fields, with
    the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results
    were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics.
    In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing
    lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared
    same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental
    leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers;
    men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation
    studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead
    of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a
    mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both
    genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers
    in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying
    for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant
    professorships.

  abstract: 'Abstract An analysis of return on investment can help policy makers support, optimize, and advocate for the expansion of immunization programs in the world’s poorest countries. We assessed the return on investment associated with achieving projected coverage levels for vaccinations to prevent diseases related to ten antigens in ninety-four low- and middle-income countries during 2011–20, the Decade of Vaccines. We derived these estimates by using costs of vaccines, supply chains, and service delivery and their associated economic benefits. Based on the costs of illnesses averted, we estimated that projected immunizations will yield a net return about 16 times greater than costs over the decade (uncertainty range: 10–25). Using a full-income approach, which quantifies the value that people place on living longer and healthier lives, we found that net returns amounted to 44 times the costs (uncertainty range: 27–67). Across all antigens, net returns were greater than costs. But to realize the substantial positive return on investment from immunization programs, it is essential that governments and donors provide the requisite investments.'

  abstract: "Biases against women in the workplace have been documented in a variety of studies. This paper presents the largest study to date on gender bias, where we compare acceptance rates of contributions from men versus women in an open source software community. Surprisingly, our results show that women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men's. However, when a woman's gender is identifiable, they are rejected more often. Our results suggest that although women on GitHub may be more competent overall, bias against them exists nonetheless."

    Within- and across-nation assessment of 10 years of PISA data'

    related
  container-title: PLoS ONE
  publisher: Public Library of Science
  page: 'e57988'
  volume: '8'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'We analyzed one decade of data collected by the Programme
    for International Student Assessment (PISA), including the mathematics and reading
    performance of nearly 1.5 million 15 year olds in 75 countries. Across nations,
    boys scored higher than girls in mathematics, but lower than girls in reading.
    The sex difference in reading was three times as large as in mathematics. There
    was considerable variation in the extent of the sex differences between nations.
    There are countries without a sex difference in mathematics performance, and in
    some countries girls scored higher than boys. Boys scored lower in reading in
    all nations in all four PISA assessments (2000, 2003, 2006, 2009). Contrary to
    several previous studies, we found no evidence that the sex differences were related
    to nations? gender equality indicators. Further, paradoxically, sex differences
    in mathematics were consistently and strongly inversely correlated with sex differences
    in reading: Countries with a smaller sex difference in mathematics had a larger
    sex difference in reading and vice versa. We demonstrate that this was not merely
    a between-nation, but also a within-nation effect. This effect is related to relative
    changes in these sex differences across the performance continuum: We did not
    find a sex difference in mathematics among the lowest performing students, but
    this is where the sex difference in reading was largest. In contrast, the sex
    difference in mathematics was largest among the higher performing students, and
    this is where the sex difference in reading was smallest. The implication is that
    if policy makers decide that changes in these sex differences are desired, different
    approaches will be needed to achieve this for reading and mathematics. Interventions
    that focus on high-achieving girls in mathematics and on low achieving boys in
    reading are likely to yield the strongest educational benefits.'

  title: Testosterone affects gaze aversion from angry faces outside of conscious
    awareness
  container-title: Psychological Science
  page: '459-463'
  volume: '23'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'Throughout vertebrate phylogeny, testosterone has motivated animals
    to obtain and maintain social dominance—a fact suggesting that unconscious primordial
    brain mechanisms are involved in social dominance. In humans, however, the prevailing
    view is that the neocortex is in control of primordial drives, and testosterone
    is thought to promote social dominance via conscious feelings of superiority,
    indefatigability, strength, and anger. Here we show that testosterone administration
    in humans prolongs dominant staring into the eyes of threatening faces that are
    viewed outside of awareness, without affecting consciously experienced feelings.
    These findings reveal that testosterone motivates social dominance in humans in
    much the same ways that it does in other vertebrates: involuntarily, automatically,
    and unconsciously.'

  abstract: Laboratory studies have documented that women often respond less favorably
    to competition than men. Conditional on performance, men are often more eager
    to compete, and the performance of men tends to respond more positively to an
    increase in competition. This means that few women enter and win competitions.
    We review studies that examine the robustness of these differences as well the
    factors that may give rise to them. Both laboratory and field studies largely
    confirm these initial findings, showing that gender differences in competitiveness
    tend to result from differences in overconfidence and in attitudes toward competition.
    Gender differences in risk aversion, however, seem to play a smaller and less
    robust role. We conclude by asking what could and should be done to encourage
    qualified males and females to compete.

  abstract: Indirect aggression includes behaviours such as criticizing a competitor’s
    appearance, spreading rumours about a person’s sexual behaviour and social exclusion.
    Human females have a particular proclivity for using indirect aggression, which
    is typically directed at other females, especially attractive and sexually available
    females, in the context of intrasexual competition for mates. Indirect aggression
    is an effective intrasexual competition strategy. It is associated with a diminished
    willingness to compete on the part of victims and with greater dating and sexual
    behaviour among those who perpetrate the aggression.

  abstract: Throughout their lives, women provide for their own and their children’s
    and grandchildren’s needs and thus must minimize their risk of incurring physical
    harm. Alliances with individuals who will assist them in attaining these goals
    increase their probability of survival and reproductive success. High status in
    the community enhances access to physical resources and valuable allies. Kin,
    a mate, and affines share a mother’s genetic interests, whereas unrelated women
    constitute primary competitors. From early childhood onwards, girls compete using
    strategies that minimize the risk of retaliation and reduce the strength of other
    girls. Girls’ competitive strategies include avoiding direct interference with
    another girl’s goals, disguising competition, competing overtly only from a position
    of high status in the community, enforcing equality within the female community
    and socially excluding other girls.

  title: A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate)
  container-title: Science
  page: '1196-1199'
  volume: '351'
  issue: '6278'
  abstract: Bacteria isolated from outside a bottle-recycling facility can break down
    and metabolize plastic. The proliferation of plastics in consumer products, from
    bottles to clothing, has resulted in the release of countless tons of plastics
    into the environment. Yoshida et al. show how the biodegradation of plastics by
    specialized bacteria could be a viable bioremediation strategy (see the Perspective
    by Bornscheuer). The new species, Ideonella sakaiensis, breaks down the plastic
    by using two enzymes to hydrolyze PET and a primary reaction intermediate, eventually
    yielding basic building blocks for growth.Science, this issue p. 1196; see also
    p. 1154Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is used extensively worldwide in plastic
    products, and its accumulation in the environment has become a global concern.
    Because the ability to enzymatically degrade PET has been thought to be limited
    to a few fungal species, biodegradation is not yet a viable remediation or recycling
    strategy. By screening natural microbial communities exposed to PET in the environment,
    we isolated a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that is able to use
    PET as its major energy and carbon source. When grown on PET, this strain produces
    two enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET and the reaction intermediate, mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
    terephthalic acid. Both enzymes are required to enzymatically convert PET efficiently
    into its two environmentally benign monomers, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.

  title: Sex differences in the structural connectome of the human brain
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '823-828'
  volume: '111'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: 'Sex differences in human behavior show adaptive complementarity: Males
    have better motor and spatial abilities, whereas females have superior memory
    and social cognition skills. Studies also show sex differences in human brains
    but do not explain this complementarity. In this work, we modeled the structural
    connectome using diffusion tensor imaging in a sample of 949 youths (aged 8–22
    y, 428 males and 521 females) and discovered unique sex differences in brain connectivity
    during the course of development. Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well
    as analysis of regional and global network measures, presented a comprehensive
    description of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions, males had
    greater within-hemispheric connectivity, as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity,
    whereas between-hemispheric connectivity and cross-module participation predominated
    in females. However, this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis
    of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between
    males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall, the results
    suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception
    and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication
    between analytical and intuitive processing modes.'

  volume: '33'

  abstract: Although latent infection with Toxoplasma gondii is among the most prevalent
    of human infections, it has been generally assumed that, except for congenital
    transmission, it is asymptomatic. The demonstration that latent Toxoplasma infections
    can alter behavior in rodents has led to a reconsideration of this assumption.
    When infected human adults were compared with uninfected adults on personality
    questionnaires or on a panel of behavioral tests, several differences were found.
    Other studies have demonstrated reduced psychomotor performance in affected individuals.
    Possible mechanisms by which T. gondii may affect human behavior include its effect
    on dopamine and on testosterone.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '15468-15473'
  volume: '112'
  issue: '50'
  abstract: 'Whereas a categorical difference in the genitals has always been acknowledged,
    the question of how far these categories extend into human biology is still not
    resolved. Documented sex/gender differences in the brain are often taken as support
    of a sexually dimorphic view of human brains (“female brain” or “male brain”).
    However, such a distinction would be possible only if sex/gender differences in
    brain features were highly dimorphic (i.e., little overlap between the forms of
    these features in males and females) and internally consistent (i.e., a brain
    has only “male” or only “female” features). Here, analysis of MRIs of more than
    1,400 human brains from four datasets reveals extensive overlap between the distributions
    of females and males for all gray matter, white matter, and connections assessed.
    Moreover, analyses of internal consistency reveal that brains with features that
    are consistently at one end of the “maleness-femaleness” continuum are rare. Rather,
    most brains are comprised of unique “mosaics” of features, some more common in
    females compared with males, some more common in males compared with females,
    and some common in both females and males. Our findings are robust across sample,
    age, type of MRI, and method of analysis. These findings are corroborated by a
    similar analysis of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviors of
    more than 5,500 individuals, which reveals that internal consistency is extremely
    rare. Our study demonstrates that, although there are sex/gender differences in
    the brain, human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories: male
    brain/female brain.'

  abstract: 'With the cooperation of the police agency of a small metropolitan community,
    45 consecutive, disposed, false rape allegations covering a 9 year period were
    studied. These false rape allegations constitute 41% the total forcible rape cases
    (n =109) reported during this period. These false allegations appear to serve
    three major functions for the complainants: providing an alibi, seeking revenge,
    and obtaining sympathy and attention. False rape allegations are not the consequence
    of a gender-linked aberration, as frequently claimed, but reflect impulsive and
    desperate efforts to cope with personal and social stress situations.'

  page: '972-975'
  volume: '321'
  issue: '8331'
  abstract: Measles mortality and measles vaccine efficacy were determined during
    outbreaks in three Gambian villages. There were 146 cases of measles among 1073
    children younger than 11 years. 30% of the children had been vaccinated against
    measles. The attack rate in unvaccinated children aged 9-47 months was 43% compared
    with 6% for children of the same age with documented measles vaccination. Vaccine
    efficacy was 37% for children vaccinated at 6-8 months of age and 89% for children
    vaccinated at 9 months or older. 5% of measles cases died before the initial investigation
    of the outbreaks and a further 10% of cases died during the ensuing 9 months.
    Only 1% of children who did not contract measles died in the 9 months after the
    outbreaks. Case-fatality rates were highest for measles patients less than 1 year
    old (64%) and fell with age. Measles remains a significant source of acute and
    delayed mortality in unvaccinated African populations.

    významnému snížení incidence pneumokokových onemocnění v dětské i dospělé

    nevakcinačních sérotypů po zavedení plošné vakcinace. Jejich původní
    registrace založené na non-inferioritě k PCV7 jsou následovány
    účinnostním studiemi. Studie FINip, zaměřená primárně na výskyt
    invazivních pneumokokových onemocnění ve Finsku, je dosud nejrozsáhlejší
    evropskou účinnostní studií, která prokázala vysokou efektivitu vakcíny
    PCV10 v prevenci IPO v reálných podmínkách. Při vyhodnocení kombinovaného
    vlivu na vakcinační i nevakcinační sérotypy byla zjištěna 93% účinnost
    proti IPO (95 % CI 75–99). Vysoká klinická účinnost vakcíny PCV10 ve
    Finsku dává možnost stejného očekávání v podmínkách České republiky.

  container-title: Journal of Infectious Diseases
  page: '1483-1486'
  volume: '186'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: In 1999–2000, a measles epidemic occurred in The Netherlands, with 3292
    reported cases; 94% of the affected patients had not been vaccinated. Only 1 patient
    had received 2 doses of vaccine. Three patients died, and 16% had complications.
    For the unvaccinated population, the incidence per 1000 inhabitants 15 months
    to 14 years old increased from 83 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 53–113), in
    municipalities with vaccine coverage rates ⩽90%, to 200 (95% CI, 153–247), in
    municipalities with coverage rates >95%; for the vaccinated population, the
    incidence increased from 0.2 (95% CI, 0.1–0.4) to 1.4 (95% CI, 0.9–1.9). Unvaccinated
    individuals were 224 times (95% CI, 148–460 times) more likely to acquire measles
    than were vaccinated individuals; the relative risk increased with decreasing
    vaccine coverage. Herd immunity outside unvaccinated clusters was high enough
    to prevent further transmission. More case patients came from the vaccine-accepting
    population living among unvaccinated clusters than from individuals who declined
    vaccination and who lived among the vaccine-accepting population

  abstract: "Sexual violence in Germany has skyrocketed since Angela Merkel allowed more than one million mostly male migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East into the country. The crimes are being downplayed by the authorities, apparently to avoid fueling anti-immigration sentiments. \"The moment they [male migrants] see a young woman wearing a skirt or any type of loose clothing, they believe they have a free pass.\" — Restaurant owner at a mall in Kiel. \"Every police officer knows he has to meet a particular political expectation. It is better to keep quiet [about migrant crime] because you cannot go wrong.\" — Rainer Wendt, head of the German police union. Police are warning about a potential breakdown of public order this summer, when women who are lightly dressed are confronted by young male migrants. Jakob Augstein, an influential columnist for the magazine Der Spiegel, says that Germans worried about migrant crimes are motivated by racism. His views shed light on the worldview of German multiculturalism: Migrants who assault German women and children are simply rebelling against German power structures. Germans who criticize such assaults are racists. Police in Cologne received more than 1,000 complaints from women, including 454 reports of sexual assaults, related to New Year's Eve. Police in Hamburg received complaints from 351 women, including 218 reports of sexual assault that took place on the same evening."

  abstract: In this paper, we use a hypothetical choice methodology to robustly estimate
    preferences for workplace attributes and quantify how much these preferences influence
    pre-labor market human capital investments. Undergraduate students are presented
    with sets of job offers that vary in their attributes (such as earnings and job
    hours flexibility) and asked to state their probabilistic choices. We show that
    this method robustly identifies preferences for various job attributes, free from
    omitted variable bias and free from considering the equilibrium matching of workers
    to jobs. While there is substantial heterogeneity in preferences, we find that
    women on average have a higher willingness to pay for jobs with greater work flexibility
    (lower hours, and part-time option availability) and job stability (lower risk
    of job loss), and men have a higher willingness to pay for jobs with higher earnings
    growth. Using a follow-up survey several years after the experiment, we find a
    systematic relationship between the respondents’ job preferences as revealed during
    college and the actual workplace characteristics of the jobs these individuals
    are currently working at after college. In the second part of the paper, we relate
    these job attribute preferences to major choice. Using data on students’ perceptions
    about the demand side of the labor market–beliefs about expected attributes of
    jobs students anticipate being offered if they were to complete particular majors–we
    find that students perceive jobs offered to Humanities majors to have fewer hours,
    more work-time flexibility, and higher stability than jobs offered to Economics/Business
    majors. These job attributes are found to play a role in major choice, with women
    exhibiting greater sensitivity to non-pecuniary job attributes in major choice.

  title: Prevalence and demographic correlates of childhood maltreatment in an adult
    community sample
  container-title: Child Abuse & Neglect
  page: '167-180'
  volume: '28'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: 'Purpose: This study had two aims: (1) to determine the prevalence of
    five categories of retrospectively reported childhood maltreatment in an adult
    community sample and (2) to examine relationships between three theoretically
    and practically chosen demographic variables and childhood maltreatment. Method:
    Participants were a representative sample of 967 adult men and women in the metropolitan
    Memphis, Tennessee area. They completed a telephone survey that included a reliable,
    valid questionnaire assessing five types of childhood maltreatment (i.e., emotional
    abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, and sexual abuse)
    and demographic questions. Simultaneous logistic regression analyses were used
    to identify demographic correlates of specific trauma types. Results: Prevalence
    of childhood maltreatment ranged from approximately 30% for women to over 40%
    for men. Approximately 13% of participants reported multiple forms of maltreatment.
    The most common forms of trauma for both men and women were physical abuse, physical
    neglect, and emotional abuse, all of which were highly likely to co-occur. Race,
    sex, and current educational level were each associated with an increased likelihood
    of childhood maltreatment; differential relationships with particular maltreatment
    types were also observed. Implications: These findings highlight the importance
    of research on the prevalence of and risks for multiple types of childhood maltreatment,
    particularly in the somewhat neglected area of emotional abuse and neglect. These
    findings can be used to highlight the need for preventive interventions aimed
    at the negative sequelae of childhood maltreatment and to tailor preventive interventions

  title: 'Perinatal mortality and severe morbidity in low and high risk term pregnancies
    in the Netherlands: Prospective cohort study'
  title-short: Perinatal mortality and severe morbidity in low and high risk term
    pregnancies in the Netherlands
  container-title: BMJ
  volume: '341'
  abstract: Objective To compare incidences of perinatal mortality and severe perinatal
    morbidity between low risk term pregnancies supervised in primary care by a midwife
    and high risk pregnancies supervised in secondary care by an obstetrician. Design
    Prospective cohort study using aggregated data from a national perinatal register. Setting
    Catchment area of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the University Medical
    Center in Utrecht, a region in the centre of the Netherlands covering 13% of the
    Dutch population. Participants Pregnant women at 37 weeks’ gestation or later with
    a singleton or twin pregnancy without congenital malformations.Main outcome measures
    Perinatal death (antepartum, intrapartum, and neonatal) or admission to a level
    3 NICU.Results During the study period 37735 normally formed infants were delivered
    at 37 weeks’ gestation or later. Sixty antepartum stillbirths (1.59 (95% confidence
    interval 1.19 to 1.99) per 1000 babies delivered), 22 intrapartum stillbirths
    (0.58 (0.34 to 0.83) per 1000 babies delivered), and 210 NICU admissions (5.58
    (4.83 to 6.33) per 1000 live births) occurred, of which 17 neonates died (0.45
    (0.24 to 0.67) per 1000 live births). The overall perinatal death rate was 2.62
    (2.11 to 3.14) per 1000 babies delivered and was significantly higher for nulliparous
    women compared with multiparous women (relative risk 1.65, 95% confidence interval
    1.11 to 2.45). Infants of pregnant women at low risk whose labour started in primary
    care under the supervision of a midwife had a significant higher risk of delivery
    related perinatal death than did infants of pregnant women at high risk whose
    labour started in secondary care under the supervision of an obstetrician (relative
    risk 2.33, 1.12 to 4.83). NICU admission rates did not differ between pregnancies
    supervised by a midwife and those supervised by an obstetrician. Infants of women
    who were referred by a midwife to an obstetrician during labour had a 3.66 times
    higher risk of delivery related perinatal death than did infants of women who
    started labour supervised by an obstetrician (relative risk 3.66, 1.58 to 8.46)
    and a 2.5-fold higher risk of NICU admission (2.51, 1.87 to 3.37). Conclusions
    Infants of pregnant women at low risk whose labour started in primary care under
    the supervision of a midwife in the Netherlands had a higher risk of delivery
    related perinatal death and the same risk of admission to the NICU compared with
    infants of pregnant women at high risk whose labour started in secondary care
    under the supervision of an obstetrician. An important limitation of the study
    is that aggregated data of a large birth registry database were used and adjustment
    for confounders and clustering was not possible. However, the findings are unexpected
    and the obstetric care system of the Netherlands needs further evaluation.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to compare the intrapartum
    and early neonatal mortality rate of planned home birth with planned hospital
    birth in community midwife-led deliveries after case mix adjustment. METHODS:
    The perinatal outcome of 679,952 low-risk women was obtained from the Netherlands
    Perinatal Registry (2000–2007). This group represents all women who had a choice
    between home and hospital birth. Two different analyses were performed: natural
    prospective approach (intention-to-treat–like analysis) and perfect guideline
    approach (per-protocol–like analysis). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs)
    were calculated. Case mix was based on the presence of at least one of the following:
    congenital abnormalities, small for gestational age, preterm birth, or low Apgar
    score. We also investigated the potential risk role of intended place of birth.
    Multivariate stepwise logistic regression was used to investigate the potential
    risk role of intended place of birth. RESULTS: Intrapartum and neonatal death
    at 0–7 days was observed in 0.15% of planned home compared with 0.18% in planned
    hospital births (crude relative risk 0.80, 95% confidence interval \[CI\] 0.71–0.91).
    After case mix adjustment, the relation is reversed, showing nonsignificant increased
    mortality risk of home birth (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91–1.21). In certain subgroups,
    additional mortality may arise at home if risk conditions emerge at birth (up
    to 20% increase). CONCLUSION: Home birth, under routine conditions, is generally
    not associated with increased intrapartum and early neonatal death, yet in subgroups,
    additional risk cannot be excluded. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II'

  title: Maternal mortality in the past and its relevance to developing countries
    today
  container-title: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
  page: 241s-246s
  volume: '72'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: High maternal mortality was a feature of the Western world from the mid-19th
    century, when reliable record keeping commenced, to the mid-1930s. During this
    time, maternal mortality rates tended to remain on a high plateau, although there
    was wide disparity between countries in the height of the plateau. From ≈1937,
    maternal mortality rates began to decline everywhere, and within 20 y, the intercountry
    differences had almost disappeared. The decline in maternal mortality rates was
    so dramatic that current rates for developed countries are between one-fortieth
    and one-fiftieth of the rates that prevailed 60 y ago. In this paper, the reasons
    for the high mortality before 1937 and its decline since that date are discussed.
    It is suggested that the main determinant of maternal mortality was the overall
    standard of maternal care provided by birth attendants. Poverty and associated
    malnutrition played little part in determining the rate of maternal mortality.
    This view is supported by much evidence, including the fact that, unlike for infant
    mortality rates, maternal mortality rates tended to be higher in the upper than
    in the lower social classes. The potential relevance of these findings to developing
    countries is discussed.

    with handwriting performance. Fine motor control, bilateral and visual–motor integration,
    motor planning, in-hand manipulation, proprioception, visual perception, sustained
    attention, and sensory awareness of the fingers are some of the component skills
    identified. Poor handwriting may be related to intrinsic factors, which refer
    to the child’s actual handwriting capabilities, or extrinsic factors which are
    related to environmental or biomechanical components, or both. It is important
    that handwriting performance be evaluated using a valid, reliable, standardized
    tool combined with informal classroom observation and teacher consultation. Studies
    of handwriting remediation suggest that intervention is effective. There is evidence
    to indicate that handwriting difficulties do not resolve without intervention
    and affect between 10 and 30% of school-aged children. Despite the widespread
    use of computers, legible handwriting remains an important life skill that deserves
    greater attention from educators and health practitioners.

  title: The diversity of regulation and public financing of IVF in Europe and its
    impact on utilization
  container-title: Human Reproduction
  page: '666-675'
  volume: '28'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: STUDY QUESTION How do the different forms of regulation and public financing
    of IVF affect utilization in otherwise similar European welfare state systems?SUMMARY
    ANSWER Countries with more liberal social eligibility regulations had higher levels
    of IVF utilization, which diminished as the countries’ policies became more restrictive.WHAT
    IS KNOWN ALREADY Europe is a world leader in the development and utilization of
    IVF, yet surveillance reveals significant differences in uptake among countries
    which have adopted different approaches to the regulation and and public financing
    of IVF.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A descriptive and comparative analysis of
    legal restrictions on access to IVF in 13 of the EU15 countries that affirmatively
    regulate and publicly finance IVF.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Using
    2009 data from the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology study
    of regulatory frameworks in Europe and additional legislative research, we examined
    and described restrictions on access to IVF in terms of general eligibility, public
    financing and the scope of available services. Multiple correspondence analysis
    was used to identify patterns of regulation and groups of countries with similar
    regulatory patterns and to explore the effects on utilization of IVF, using data
    from the most recent European and international IVF monitoring reports.MAIN RESULTS
    AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Regulations based on social characteristics of treatment
    seekers who are not applicable to other medical treatments, including relationship
    status and sexual orientation, appear to have the greatest impact on utilization.
    Countries with the most generous public financing schemes tend to restrict access
    to covered IVF to a greater degree. However, no link could be established between
    IVF utilization and the manner in which coverage was regulated or the level of
    public financing.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Owing to the lack of data regarding
    the actual level of public versus private financing of IVF it is impossible to
    draw conclusions regarding equity of access. Moreover, the regulatory and utilization
    data were not completely temporally matched in what can be a quickly changing
    regulatory landscape.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Whether motivated by cost,
    eligility restrictions or the availability of particular services, cross-border
    treatment seeking is driven by regulatory policies, underscoring the extra-territorial
    implications of in-country political decisions regarding access to IVF.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING
    INTEREST(S) There was no funding source for this study. The authors have no conflicts
    of interest to declare.

  abstract: This paper explores racial differences in police use of force. On non-lethal
    uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to
    experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that
    account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully
    explain, these disparities. On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved
    shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual
    factors are taken into account. We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent
    with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which
    have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs
    of officer-involved shootings.

    they should be the subject rather than the procedure of science. What I call the
    “null ritual” consists of three steps: (1) set up a statistical null hypothesis,
    but do not specify your own hypothesis nor any alternative hypothesis, (2) use
    the 5% significance level for rejecting the null and accepting your hypothesis,
    and (3) always perform this procedure. I report evidence of the resulting collective
    confusion and fears about sanctions on the part of students and teachers, researchers
    and editors, as well as textbook writers.'

  abstract: The paper introduces the phenomenon of domestic violence, which is quite
    a new topic in Czech sociology. The author uses data collected from the sociological
    research ’1999 Safety Risks’ which was accomplished in May 1999. One part of this
    research was devoted to the subject of violence in the family. The theoretical
    part of the article deals with some specific phenomena of the general problem
    in question, including certain myths closely associated with it. The family with
    its original structure and character as a specific ’place of conflict’ is also
    discussed. An analysis of the attitudes and tolerance of Czech society towards
    violent forms of behaviour between partners as well as towards the physical punishment
    of children represents the key part of the article. In both cases (violent behaviour
    between partners and the physical punishment of children) the author uses factor
    analysis to define three main lines of violent behaviour. The factor scores then
    form a basis for the multivariate analysis to make the best possible picture of
    attitude differences within several social groups, particularly between men and
    women, and contrasts due to different levels of education. Significant variances
    from both of these viewpoints have been discovered and are discussed. The last
    part of the paper is devoted to analysing and specifying the main external distress
    factors that play a very important role within the developments of violent forms
    of behaviour in the family.

  title: 'Violence in lesbian and gay relationships: Theory, prevalence, and correlational
    factors'
  container-title: Clinical Psychology Review
  page: '487-512'
  volume: '19'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: This article reviews and critiques the existing empirical literature examining
    interpersonal violence in lesbian and gay relationships. Studies assessing psychological,
    physical, and nonconsenting sexual forms of violence in intimate, same-sex relationships
    are reviewed, and their findings are integrated with what is known about partner
    abuse in heterosexual relationships. Nineteen studies are described and categorized
    according to the specific questions being addressed. This body of literature suggests
    that prevalence rates of same-sex partner abuse are high and its correlates show
    many similarities to those identified in incidents of heterosexual partner abuse.
    This article addresses the need for substantially increased efforts in this field
    of study in terms of well-controlled and theory-driven research design. In terms
    of other implications of this body of literature, the high prevalence rate of
    partner abuse among lesbian and gay populations needs to be recognized by providers
    of both physical and mental health services who potentially treat victims, so
    that they can more accurately identify appropriate interventions. More research
    is warranted, not only in the general area of lesbian and gay partner abuse, but
    in examining various treatment modalities and their effectiveness in helping perpetrators
    to end the cycle of violence.

  container-title: Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy
  publisher: Routledge
  page: '636-648'
  volume: '41'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: Domestic violence is a significant public health issue. Prevalence rates
    for same-sex domestic violence vary because of methodological issues related to
    recruitment and definitions of sexual orientation. However, such prevalence rates
    are currently considered to be similar to slightly greater than other-sex prevalence
    rates. Research has identified differences between same-sex domestic violence
    and other-sex domestic violence, including internalized and externalized stressors
    associated with being a sexual minority that interact with domestic violence to
    create or exacerbate vulnerabilities, higher risk for complex trauma experiences,
    and difficulties accessing services. This review provides a critical review of
    the literature, focusing upon empirical findings regarding same-sex domestic violence.

  title: Systems analysis of sex differences reveals an immunosuppressive role for
    testosterone in the response to influenza vaccination
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '869-874'
  volume: '111'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Females have generally more robust immune responses than males for reasons
    that are not well-understood. Here we used a systems analysis to investigate these
    differences by analyzing the neutralizing antibody response to a trivalent inactivated
    seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) and a large number of immune system components,
    including serum cytokines and chemokines, blood cell subset frequencies, genome-wide
    gene expression, and cellular responses to diverse in vitro stimuli, in 53 females
    and 34 males of different ages. We found elevated antibody responses to TIV and
    expression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum of females compared with males
    regardless of age. This inflammatory profile correlated with the levels of phosphorylated
    STAT3 proteins in monocytes but not with the serological response to the vaccine.
    In contrast, using a machine learning approach, we identified a cluster of genes
    involved in lipid biosynthesis and previously shown to be up-regulated by testosterone
    that correlated with poor virus-neutralizing activity in men. Moreover, men with
    elevated serum testosterone levels and associated gene signatures exhibited the
    lowest antibody responses to TIV. These results demonstrate a strong association
    between androgens and genes involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting that these
    could be important drivers of the differences in immune responses between males
    and females.

    Republic'
  container-title: Labour Economics
  page: '234-244'
  volume: '30'
  abstract: Abstract While joint taxation is fairly widespread across European countries,
    the evidence of its labor supply effects is scarce due to a lack of recent policy
    changes. This study makes use of the introduction of joint taxation in the Czech
    Republic in 2005 to estimate its effect on married couples’ labor supply. Results
    based on difference-in-differences and on triple differences with several alternative
    control groups suggest that the introduction of joint taxation lead to a decline
    of about 3 percentage points in the employment rate of married women with children.
    Participation declines are twice as large when the tax work disincentives are
    highest—among women with tertiary-educated husbands. The introduction of joint
    taxation did not affect the employment probability of married men with children.

  title: Science faculty’s subtle gender biases favor male students
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '16474-16479'
  volume: '109'
  issue: '41'
  abstract: Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity
    persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias
    in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether
    science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to
    the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n
    = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application
    materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for
    a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as
    significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant.
    These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career
    mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not
    affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit
    bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female
    student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent.
    We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using
    a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played
    a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less

    These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might
    advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.

  title: Understanding the role of p values and hypothesis tests in clinical research
  container-title: JAMA Cardiology
  abstract: P values and hypothesis testing methods are frequently misused in clinical
    research. Much of this misuse appears to be owing to the widespread, mistaken
    belief that they provide simple, reliable, and objective triage tools for separating
    the true and important from the untrue or unimportant. The primary focus in interpreting
    therapeutic clinical research data should be on the treatment (“oomph”) effect,
    a metaphorical force that moves patients given an effective treatment to a different
    clinical state relative to their control counterparts. This effect is assessed
    using 2 complementary types of statistical measures calculated from the data,
    namely, effect magnitude or size and precision of the effect size. In a randomized
    trial, effect size is often summarized using constructs, such as odds ratios,
    hazard ratios, relative risks, or adverse event rate differences. How large a
    treatment effect has to be to be consequential is a matter for clinical judgment.
    The precision of the effect size (conceptually related to the amount of spread
    in the data) is usually addressed with confidence intervals. P values (significance
    tests) were first proposed as an informal heuristic to help assess how “unexpected”
    the observed effect size was if the true state of nature was no effect or no difference.
    Hypothesis testing was a modification of the significance test approach that envisioned
    controlling the false-positive rate of study results over many (hypothetical)
    repetitions of the experiment of interest. Both can be helpful but, by themselves,
    provide only a tunnel vision perspective on study results that ignores the clinical
    effects the study was conducted to measure.

  volume: '39'

  abstract: Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) are a wide range of congenital conditions
    characterized by an incongruence of components involved in sexual differentiation,
    including gender psychosexual development. The management of such disorders is
    complex, and one of the most crucial decision is represented by gender assignment.
    In fact, the primary goal in DSD is to have a gender assignment consistent with
    the underlying gender identity in order to prevent the distress related to a forthcoming
    Gender Dysphoria. Historically, gender assignment was based essentially on surgical
    outcomes, assuming the neutrality of gender identity at birth. This policy has
    been challenged in the past decade refocusing on the importance of prenatal and
    postnatal hormonal and genetic influences on psychosexual development.

  title: Individual Differences in Testosterone Predict Persistence in Men
  container-title: European Journal of Personality
  page: '83-89'
  volume: '29'
  issue: '1'
  note: EJP-13-1671.R2
  abstract: Persistence is an important predictor of future successes. The present
    research addresses the relationship between testosterone and persistence in men.
    One hundred eighteen men were randomly assigned to win or lose a competitive number
    tracing task against a confederate or complete the task alone in a non-competitive
    control condition. Saliva samples were collected prior to and after the competition
    or control conditions. Participants were then given a maximum time of 30to spend
    attempting to solve unsolvable puzzles, with the option to quit at any time. In
    contrast to our prediction, changes in testosterone concentrations in response
    to the competitive interaction did not predict persistence behaviour. However,
    individual differences in testosterone concentrations (pre-competition/non-competition)
    were positively correlated with persistence. These findings are the first to examine
    associations between neuroendocrine function and persistence behaviour in people
    and suggest that testosterone should also be considered when predicting persistence-related
    outcomes. Copyright 2014 European Association of Personality Psychology

Tento odpor je velmi starý a počal již s vakcinací proti černým neštovicím. Nová vlna antivakcinačního hnutí byla v posledních letech importována internetem. Cui bono? Profesionální antivakcionisté, kteří obratně manipulují s polopravdami jsou většinou lékaři, kteří mají komerční zájem na alternativních metodách, jež nejsou hrazeny zdravotními pojišťovnami, jako jsou homeopatie, autopatie, detoxikace apod. K očkování je důležité přesvědčovat rodiče klidně a bez konfrontace. S antivakcionisty musí diskutovat vedoucí odborníci pomocí nezvratitelných faktů.

  title: Understanding the broad influence of sex hormones and sex differences in
    the brain
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '24-39'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Sex hormones act throughout the entire brain of both males and females
    via both genomic and nongenomic receptors. Sex hormones can act through many cellular
    and molecular processes that alter structure and function of neural systems and
    influence behavior as well as providing neuroprotection. Within neurons, sex hormone
    receptors are found in nuclei and are also located near membranes, where they
    are associated with presynaptic terminals, mitochondria, spine apparatus, and
    postsynaptic densities. Sex hormone receptors also are found in glial cells. Hormonal
    regulation of a variety of signaling pathways as well as direct and indirect effects
    on gene expression induce spine synapses, up- or downregulate and alter the distribution
    of neurotransmitter receptors, and regulate neuropeptide expression and cholinergic
    and GABAergic activity as well as calcium sequestration and oxidative stress.
    Many neural and behavioral functions are affected, including mood, cognitive function,
    blood pressure regulation, motor coordination, pain, and opioid sensitivity. Subtle
    sex differences exist for many of these functions that are developmentally programmed
    by hormones and by not yet precisely defined genetic factors, including the mitochondrial
    genome. These sex differences and responses to sex hormones in brain regions,
    which influence functions not previously regarded as subject to such differences,
    indicate that we are entering a new era of our ability to understand and appreciate
    the diversity of gender-related behaviors and brain functions. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract: Biological sex and sex hormones are known to affect functional cerebral
    asymmetries (FCAs). Men are generally more lateralized than women. The effect
    size of this sex difference is small but robust. Some of the inconsistencies in
    the literature may be explained by sex-related hormonal differences. Most studies
    focusing on neuromodulatory properties of sex hormones on FCAs have investigated
    women during the menstrual cycle. Although contradictions exist, these studies
    have typically shown that levels of estradiol and/or progesterone correlate with
    the degree of FCAs, suggesting that sex differences in FCAs partially depend on
    hormonal state and day of testing. The results indicate that FCAs are not fixed
    but are hormone dependent, and as such they can dynamically change within relatively
    short periods throughout life. Many issues raised in this Mini-Review refer not
    only to FCAs but also to other aspects of functional brain organization, such
    as functional connectivity within and between the cerebral hemispheres. Our understanding
    of sex differences in brain and behavior as well as their clinical relevance will
    improve significantly if more studies routinely take sex and sex hormones into
    account. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Sex differences exist in the vulnerability, incidence, manifestation,
    and treatment of numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases. Despite this
    observation prominent in the literature, little consideration has been given to
    possible sex differences in outcome in both preclinical and clinical research.
    This Mini-Review highlights evidence supporting why studying sex differences matter
    for advances in brain health as well as improving treatment for neurological and
    psychiatric disease. Additionally, we discuss some statistical and methodological
    considerations in evaluating sex differences as well as how differences in the
    physiology of the sexes can contribute to sex difference in disease incidence
    and manifestation. Furthermore, we review literature demonstrating that the reproductive
    experience in the female can render the female brain differentially vulnerable
    to disease across age. Finally, we discuss how genes interact with sex to influence
    disease risk and treatment and argue that sex must be considered in precision
    medicine. Together the evidence reviewed here supports the inclusion of males
    and females at all levels of neuroscience research. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    in brain and behavior: Lessons from cases of disorders of sex development'
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '65-74'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Sex differences in brain development and postnatal behavior are determined
    largely by genetic sex and in utero gonadal hormone secretions. In humans however,
    determining the weight that each of these factors contributes remains a challenge
    because social influences should also be considered. Cases of disorders of sex
    development (DSD) provide unique insight into how mutations in genes responsible
    for gonadal formation can perturb the subsequent developmental hormonal milieu
    and elicit changes in normal human brain maturation. Specific forms of DSDs such
    as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), congenital adrenal hyperplasia
    (CAH), and 5$\alpha$-reductase deficiency syndrome have variable effects between
    males and females, and the developmental outcomes of such conditions are largely
    dependent on sex chromosome composition. Medical and psychological works focused
    on CAH, CAIS, and 5$\alpha$-reductase deficiency have helped form the foundation
    for understanding the roles of genetic and hormonal factors necessary for guiding
    human brain development. Here we highlight how the three aforementioned DSDs contribute
    to brain and behavioral phenotypes that can uniquely affect 46,XY and 46,XX individuals
    in dramatically different fashions. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Sex-specific mechanisms for responding to stress
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '75-82'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression share stress as an
    etiological contributor and are more common in women than in men. Traditionally,
    preclinical studies investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of stress
    vulnerability have used only male rodents; however, recent studies that include
    females are finding sex-specific mechanisms for responding to stress. This Mini-Review
    examines recent literature using a framework developed by McCarthy and colleagues
    (2012; J Neurosci 32:2241–2247) that highlights different types of sex differences.
    First, we detail how learned fear responses in rats are sexually dimorphic. Then,
    we contrast this finding with fear extinction, which is similar in males and females
    at the behavioral level but at the circuitry level is associated with sex-specific
    cellular changes and, thus, exemplifies a sex convergence. Next, sex differences
    in stress hormones are detailed. Finally, the effects of stress on learning, attention,
    and arousal are used to highlight the concept of a sex divergence in which the
    behavior of males and females is similar at baseline but diverges following stressor
    exposure. We argue that appreciating and investigating the diversity of sex differences
    in stress response systems will improve our understanding of vulnerability and
    resilience to stress-related psychiatric disorders and likely lead to the development
    of novel therapeutics for better treatment of these disorders in both men and
    women. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Stress is a major risk factor for development of psychiatric disorders
    such as depression and development of substance use disorder. Although there are
    important sex differences in the prevalence of these disorders, most preclinical
    models used to study stress-induced disorders have used males only. Social defeat
    stress is a commonly used method to induce stress in an ethologically relevant
    way but has only recently begun to be used in female rodents. Using these new
    female models, recent studies have examined how social defeat stress affects males
    and females differently at the behavioral, circuit, and molecular levels. This
    Mini-Review discusses sex differences in the effects of social defeat stress on
    social behavior and drug-seeking behavior as well as its impact on the mesolimbic
    dopamine system and the highly connected region of the bed nucleus of the stria
    terminalis. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Sex differences in stress effects on emotional learning
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '93-105'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Stress influences emotional learning and memory processes. These effects
    are thought to underlie stress-associated mental disorders. Sex differences in
    stress reactivity and in central nervous system stress sensitivity illustrate
    the important modulatory role of sex hormones. This Review outlines how stress
    hormones influence different stages of the fear conditioning process, such as
    fear acquisition, extinction, and retrieval. Results will be compared with findings
    on the impact of stress on episodic memory. The focus is on the available human
    data on sex differences and the impact sex hormones have on the stress effects
    on emotional learning and memory. It will become apparent that the menstrual cycle
    but also the intake of hormonal contraceptives modulates the impact of stress
    on brain and behavior. Additional basic research is needed for a deeper insight
    regarding the interplay between stress and sex hormones in emotion and cognition.
    In addition, new treatment options might be derived to optimize existing strategies
    such as exposure therapy, which relies on the principles of fear conditioning.

  abstract: 'Acute psychological stress affects each of us in our daily lives and
    is increasingly a topic of discussion for its role in mental illness, aging, cognition,
    and overall health. A better understanding of how such stress affects the body
    and mind could contribute to the development of more effective clinical interventions
    and prevention practices. Over the past 3 decades, the Trier Social Stress Test
    (TSST) has been widely used to induce acute stress in a laboratory setting based
    on the principles of social evaluative threat, namely, a judged speech-making
    task. A comparable alternative task may expand options for examining acute stress
    in a controlled laboratory setting. This study uses a within-subjects design to
    examine healthy adult participants’ (n=20 men, n=20 women) subjective stress and
    salivary cortisol responses to the standard TSST (involving public speaking and
    math) and the newly created Iowa Singing Social Stress Test (I-SSST). The I-SSST
    is similar to the TSST but with a new twist: public singing. Results indicated
    that men and women reported similarly high levels of subjective stress in response
    to both tasks. However, men and women demonstrated different cortisol responses;
    men showed a robust response to both tasks, and women displayed a lesser response.
    These findings are in line with previous literature and further underscore the
    importance of examining possible sex differences throughout various phases of
    research, including design, analysis, and interpretation of results. Furthermore,
    this nascent examination of the I-SSST suggests a possible alternative for inducing
    stress in the laboratory. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'

  title: Gender differences in neural correlates of stress-induced anxiety
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '115-125'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Although gender differences have been identified as a crucial factor for
    understanding stress-related anxiety and associated clinical disorders, the neural
    mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. To explore gender differences
    in the neural correlates of stress-induced anxiety, the current study used functional
    magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain responses in 96 healthy men and women
    with commensurable levels of trait anxiety as they engaged in a personalized guided
    imagery paradigm to provoke stress and neutral-relaxing experiences. During the
    task, a significant gender main effect emerged, with men displaying greater responses
    in the caudate, cingulate gyrus, midbrain, thalamus, and cerebellum. In contrast,
    women showed greater responses in the posterior insula, temporal gyrus, and occipital
    lobe. Additionally, a significant anxiety ratings gender interaction from whole-brain
    regression analyses was observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left inferior
    parietal lobe, left temporal gyrus, occipital gyrus, and cerebellum (P&lt;0.05,
    whole-brain family-wise error corrected), with positive associations between activity
    in these regions and stress-induced anxiety in women, but negative associations
    in men, indicating that men and women differentially use neural resources when
    experiencing stress-induced anxiety. The findings suggest that in response to
    stress, there is a greater use of the medial prefrontal–parietal cortices in experiencing
    subjective anxiety in women, while decreased use of this circuit was associated
    with increased subjective anxiety states in men. The current study has implications
    for understanding gender-specific differences in stress-induced anxiety and vulnerability
    to stress-related clinical disorders, and for developing more effective treatment
    strategies tailored to each gender. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    contraceptive users
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '126-135'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Oral contraceptive (OC) users typically show a blunted or no cortisol
    response to psychosocial stress. Although most OC regimens include both an inactive
    (dummy) and active pill phase, studies have not systematically investigated cortisol
    responses during these pill phases. Further, high levels of cortisol following
    a stressor diminish retrieval of emotional material, but the effects of stress
    on memory among OC users are poorly understood. We examined the effects of a psychosocial
    stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test, vs. a control condition on cortisol responsivity
    and emotional memory retrieval in women tested either during their active (n=18)
    or inactive pill phase (n=21). In secondary analyses, we quantitatively compared
    OC users with normally cycling women and showed a significant lack of cortisol
    response during both active and inactive pill phase. Emotional recall did not
    differ between active and inactive pill phases. Stress differentially diminished
    recall of negative words compared with positive or neutral words, but cortisol
    levels were unrelated to memory performance. These findings indicate that OC users
    have distinct cortisol and memory responses to stress that are similar between
    the active and inactive pill phases. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: This review discusses alcohol and other forms of drug addiction as both
    a sociocultural and biological phenomenon. Sex differences and gender are not
    solely determined by biology, nor are they entirely sociocultural. The interactions
    among biological, environmental, sociocultural, and developmental influences result
    in phenotypes that may be more masculine or more feminine. These gender-related
    sex differences in the brain can influence the responses to drugs of abuse, progressive
    changes in the brain after exposure to drugs of abuse and whether addiction results
    from drug-taking experiences. In addition, the basic laboratory evidence for sex
    differences is discussed within the context of four types of sex/gender differences.

  title: Sex differences in nicotine preference
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '148-162'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Smoking is the major cause of preventable deaths worldwide, and although
    there is a decline in overall smoking prevalence in developed countries, the decline
    in women is less pronounced than in men. Women become dependent faster and experience
    greater difficulties in quitting. Similar trends have been observed in animal
    models of nicotine/tobacco addiction. Individual differences in vulnerability
    to drug abuse are also observed in nicotine/tobacco addiction and point to the
    importance of sex differences. This Review, summarizes findings from three experimental
    approaches used to depict nicotine preference in animal models, intravenous and
    oral nicotine self-administration and nicotine-induced conditioned place preference.
    Nicotine preference is considered to be reflected in the animal’s motivation to
    administer the drug (intravenously or orally) or to prefer an environment paired
    with the presence of the drug (conditioned place preference). These approaches
    all point to the importance of sex and age of the subjects; the preference of
    females and adolescents appear to be more pronounced than that of males and adults,
    respectively. A closer look at these factors will help us understand the mechanisms
    that underlie nicotine addiction and develop strategies to cope. Ignoring sex
    differences and reaching conclusions based only on studies using male subjects
    has resulted in erroneous generalizations in the past. Sex differences in nicotine
    preference have been clearly documented, and awareness on this aspect of nicotine
    dependence will significantly impact our success in translational research. 2016

  title: Estradiol shifts interactions between the infralimbic cortex and central
    amygdala to enhance fear extinction memory in female rats
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '163-175'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: There is growing evidence that estradiol (E2) enhances fear extinction
    memory consolidation. However, it is unclear how E2 influences the nodes of the
    fear extinction network to enhance extinction memory. This study begins to delineate
    the neural circuits underlying the influence of E2 on fear extinction acquisition
    and consolidation in female rats. After fear conditioning (day 1), naturally cycling
    female rats underwent extinction learning (day 2) in a low-E2 state, receiving
    a systemic administration of either E2 or vehicle prior to extinction training.
    Extinction memory recall was then tested 24later (day 3). We measured immediate
    early gene c-fos expression within the extinction network during fear extinction
    learning and extinction recall. During extinction learning, E2 treatment increased
    centrolateral amygdala c-fos activity and reduced lateral amygdala activity relative
    to vehicle. During extinction recall, E2-treated rats exhibited reduced c-fos
    expression in the centromedial amygdala. There were no group differences in c-fos
    expression within the medial prefrontal cortex or dorsal hippocampus. Examining
    c-fos ratios with the infralimbic cortex (IL) revealed that, despite the lack
    of group differences within the IL, E2 treatment induced greater IL activity relative
    to both prelimbic cortex and central amygdala (CeA) activity during extinction
    memory recall. Only the relationship between IL and CeA activity positively correlated
    with extinction retention. In conclusion, E2 appears to modify interactions between
    the IL and the CeA in females, shifting from stronger amygdalar modulation of
    fear during extinction learning to stronger IL control during extinction recall.

  title: Magnetoencephalography study of different relationships among low- and high-frequency-band
    neural activities during the induction of peaceful and fearful audiovisual modalities
    among males and females
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '176-188'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Our previous study estimated the bias from the match attributes of the
    auditory and visual modalities related to a peaceful mood in the male brain. However,
    the interactions among the four main frequency bands of neural activity remain
    unknown. Therefore, this study uses magnetoencephalography to explore gender differences
    in the perceptions of auditory and visual modalities related to peaceful and fearful
    moods. Instead of analyzing single frequencies, this study analyzes interactions
    between low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude to reflect neural communication.
    The top four values in each of the 10 brain regions were averaged to give a representative
    value for further analysis with repeated-measures ANOVA. The results from the
    cross-frequency analyses suggest that delta–theta, delta–alpha, delta–beta, and
    delta–gamma couplings are associated with interactions between emotion and modality;
    theta–alpha, theta–beta, and theta–gamma couplings are associated with interactions
    between gender and emotion/time; alpha–beta and alpha–gamma couplings are associated
    with time; and beta–gamma coupling is associated with interactions between gender
    and modality. Although no obvious hemispheric lateralization of emotion in the
    macroscopic neural activity was found, these results reveal that males have stronger
    couplings (e.g., beta–gamma coupling) in the visual modality related to peaceful
    mood, whereas females have stronger couplings (e.g., beta–gamma coupling) in the
    audiovisual modality related to fearful mood. Gender differences become much more
    apparent when analysis is based on cross-frequency coupling. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract: Although, overwhelmingly, behavior is similar in males and females, and,
    correspondingly, the brains are similar, sex differences permeate both brain and
    behavioral measures, and these differences have been the focus of increasing scrutiny
    by neuroscientists. This Review describes milestones from more than 3 decades
    of research in brain and behavior. This research was necessarily bound by available
    methodology, and we began with indirect behavioral indicators of brain function
    such as handedness. We proceeded to the use of neuropsychological batteries and
    then to structural and functional neuroimaging that provided the foundations of
    a cognitive neuroscience-based computerized neurocognitive battery. Sex differences
    were apparent and consistent in neurocognitive measures, with females performing
    better on memory and social cognition tasks and males on spatial processing and
    motor speed. Sex differences were also prominent in all major brain parameters,
    including higher rates of cerebral blood flow, higher percentage of gray matter
    tissue, and higher interhemispheric connectivity in females, compared with higher
    percentage of white matter and greater intrahemispheric connectivity as well as
    higher glucose metabolism in limbic regions in males. Many of these differences
    are present in childhood, but they become more prominent with adolescence, perhaps
    linked to puberty. Overall, they indicate complementarity between the sexes that
    would result in greater adaptive diversity. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: 'A substantial number of studies provide evidence documenting a variety
    of sex differences in the brain. It remains unclear whether sexual differentiation
    at the neural level is related to that observed in daily behavior, cognitive function,
    and the risk of developing certain psychiatric and neurological disorders. Some
    investigators have questioned whether the brain is truly sexually differentiated
    and support this view with several arguments including the following: (1) brain
    structural or functional differences are not necessarily reflected in appropriate
    differences at the behavioral level, which might suggest that these two phenomena
    are not linked to each other; and (2) sex-related differences in the brain are
    rather small and concern features that significantly overlap between males and
    females. This review polemicizes with those opinions and presents examples of
    sex-related local neural differences underpinning a variety of sex differences
    in behaviors, skills, and cognitive/emotional abilities. Although male/female
    brain differentiation may vary in pattern and scale, nonetheless, in some respects
    (e.g., relative local gray matter volumes) it can be substantial, taking the form
    of sexual dimorphism and involving large areas of the brain (the cortex in particular).
    A significant part of this review is devoted to arguing that some sex differences
    in the brain may serve to prevent (in the case where they are maladaptive), rather
    than to produce, differences at the behavioral/skill level. Specifically, some
    differences might result from compensatory mechanisms aimed at maintaining similar
    intellectual capacities across the sexes, despite the smaller average volume of
    the brain in females compared with males. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'

  abstract: Sex differences in behavior and developmental trajectories in human children
    are of great interest to researchers in a variety of fields, and a persistent
    topic of discussion and debate is the relative contribution of biological vs.
    social influences to such differences. Given the potentially large effects of
    cultural and social influences on human child development, nonhuman primates are
    important model species for investigating the biological and evolutionary roots
    of sex differences in human development. This Mini-Review briefly summarizes the
    existing literature on sex-biased behavior toward infant nonhuman primates by
    mothers and other social partners, followed by a review of findings on sex differences
    (or lack thereof) in primate behavioral development from a variety of species
    in wild and naturalistic settings. These include differences in physical and social
    development, including play, grooming, and object manipulation patterns, as well
    as nursing and the development of foraging behavior. The Mini-Review concludes
    by providing potential avenues for future research. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Several studies have demonstrated that women show a greater interest for
    social information and empathic attitude than men. This article reviews studies
    on sex differences in the brain, with particular reference to how males and females
    process faces and facial expressions, social interactions, pain of others, infant
    faces, faces in things (pareidolia phenomenon), opposite-sex faces, humans vs.
    landscapes, incongruent behavior, motor actions, biological motion, erotic pictures,
    and emotional information. Sex differences in oxytocin-based attachment response
    and emotional memory are also mentioned. In addition, we investigated how 400
    different human faces were evaluated for arousal and valence dimensions by a group
    of healthy male and female University students. Stimuli were carefully balanced
    for sensory and perceptual characteristics, age, facial expression, and sex. As
    a whole, women judged all human faces as more positive and more arousing than
    men. Furthermore, they showed a preference for the faces of children and the elderly
    in the arousal evaluation. Regardless of face aesthetics, age, or facial expression,
    women rated human faces higher than men. The preference for opposite- vs. same-sex
    faces strongly interacted with facial age. Overall, both women and men exhibited
    differences in facial processing that could be interpreted in the light of evolutionary
    psychobiology. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '235-250'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: 'As the most fascinating, complex, and dynamic part of our organism,
    the human brain is shaped by many interacting factors that not only are of neurobiological
    (including sex hormones) and environmental origin but are also sociocultural in
    their very nature (such as social roles). Gender is one of these factors. Most
    neurological, neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and psychosomatic disorders
    are characterized by impairments in visual social cognition (primarily body language
    reading and face perception) and a skewed sex ratio: females and males are affected
    differently in terms of clinical picture, prevalence, and severity. Is the social
    brain sex specific? This is still an open question. For a long time and for many
    reasons, sex differences have been overlooked or entirely ignored in neuroscience
    and biomedical research: there is a paucity of neuroimaging work examining sex
    differences in the social brain. However, the pattern of experimental behavioral
    data in both healthy, typically developing individuals and patients with deficient
    social cognition is beyond simple interpretation: contrary to popular wisdom,
    females are not always more proficient in understanding social signals, and their
    social abilities may be particularly affected by disease. Clarification of how
    neurobiological sex and sociocultural gender affect the social brain would provide
    novel insights into understanding gender-specific vulnerability to neuropsychiatric
    disorders. This interaction is far beyond simplicity. Although sex differences
    represent a rather delicate topic, underestimation or exaggeration of possible
    effects retards progress in the field. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'

    paradigm
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '251-259'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: During the course of serious discussion, an unexpected interruption may
    induce forgetting of the original topic of a conversation. Sex, age, and sex hormone
    levels may affect frequency and extension of forgetting. In a list-method directed
    forgetting paradigm, subjects have to learn two word lists. After learning list
    1, subjects receive either a forget or a remember list 1 cue. When the participants
    had learned list 2 and completed a distraction task, they were asked to write
    down as many recalled items as possible, starting either with list 1 or list 2
    items. In the present study, 96 naturally cycling women, 60 oral contraceptive
    users, 56 postmenopausal women, and 41 young men were assigned to one of these
    different experimental conditions. Forget-cued young subjects recall fewer list
    1 items (list 1 forgetting) but more list 2 items (list 2 enhancement) compared
    with remember-cued subjects. However, forget-cued postmenopausal women showed
    reduced list 1 forgetting but enhanced list 2 retention. Remember-cued naturally
    cycling women recalled more list 1 items than oral contraceptive users, young
    men, and postmenopausal women. In forget-cued follicular women, salivary progesterone
    correlated positively with recalled list 2 items. Salivary 17$\beta$-estradiol
    did not correlate with recalled list 1 or list 2 items in either remember- or
    forget-cued young women. However, salivary 17$\beta$-estradiol correlated with
    item recall in remember-cued postmenopausal women. Our findings suggest that sex
    hormones do not globally modulate verbal memory or forgetting, but selectively
    affect cue-specific processing. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: The ability to weigh the costs and benefits of various options to make
    an adaptive decision is critical to an organism’s survival and wellbeing. Many
    psychiatric diseases are characterized by maladaptive decision making, indicating
    a need for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process and
    the ways in which it is altered under pathological conditions. Great strides have
    been made in uncovering these mechanisms, but the majority of what is known comes
    from studies conducted solely in male subjects. In recent years, decision-making
    research has begun to include female subjects to determine whether sex differences
    exist and to identify the mechanisms that contribute to such differences. This
    Mini-Review begins by describing studies that have examined sex differences in
    animal (largely rodent) models of decision making. Possible explanations, both
    theoretical and biological, for such differences in decision making are then considered.
    The Mini-Review concludes with a discussion of the implications of sex differences
    in decision making for understanding psychiatric conditions. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

    making in the human brain
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '270-278'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Dating back to the case of Phineas Gage, decades of neuropsychological
    research have shown that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is crucial
    to both real-world social functioning and abstract decision making in the laboratory
    (see, e.g., Stuss et al., ; Bechara et al., 1994; Damasio et al., ). Previous
    research has shown that the relationship between the laterality of individuals’
    vmPFC lesions and neuropsychological performance is moderated by their sex, whereby
    there are more severe social, emotional, and decision-making impairments in men
    with right-side vmPFC lesions and in women with left-side vmPFC lesions (Tranel
    et al., 2005; Sutterer et al., 2015). We conducted a selective review of studies
    examining the effect of vmPFC lesions on emotion and decision making and found
    further evidence of sex-related differences in the lateralization of function
    not only in the vmPFC but also in other neurological structures associated with
    decision making and emotion. This Mini-Review suggests that both sex and laterality
    effects warrant more careful consideration in the scientific literature. 2016

  title: Sex-dependent differences in voluntary physical activity
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '279-290'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Numbers of overweight and obese individuals are increasing in the United
    States and globally, and, correspondingly, the associated health care costs are
    rising dramatically. More than one-third of children are currently considered
    obese with a predisposition to type 2 diabetes, and it is likely that their metabolic
    conditions will worsen with age. Physical inactivity has also risen to be the
    leading cause of many chronic, noncommunicable diseases (NCD). Children are more
    physically inactive now than they were in past decades, which may be due to intrinsic
    and extrinsic factors. In rodents, the amount of time engaged in spontaneous activity
    within the home cage is a strong predictor of later adiposity and weight gain.
    Thus, it is important to understand primary motivators stimulating physical activity
    (PA). There are normal sex differences in PA levels in rodents and humans. The
    perinatal environment can induce sex-dependent differences in PA disturbances.
    This Review considers the current evidence for sex differences in PA in rodents
    and humans. The rodent studies showing that early exposure to environmental chemicals
    can shape later adult PA responses are discussed. Next, whether there are different
    motivators stimulating exercise in male vs. female humans are examined. Finally,
    the brain regions, genes, and pathways that modulate PA in rodents, and possibly
    by translation in humans, are described. A better understanding of why each sex
    remains physically active through the life span could open new avenues for preventing
    and treating obesity in children and adults. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: A general theory of sexual differentiation
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '291-300'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: A general theory of mammalian sexual differentiation is proposed. All
    biological sex differences are the result of the inequality in effects of the
    sex chromosomes, which are the only factors that differ in XX vs. XY zygotes.
    This inequality leads to male-specific effects of the Y chromosome, including
    expression of the testis-determining gene Sry that causes differentiation of testes.
    Thus, Sry sets up lifelong sex differences in effects of gonadal hormones. Y genes
    also act outside of the gonads to cause male-specific effects. Differences in
    the number of X chromosomes between XX and XY cells cause sex differences in expression
    (1) of Xist, (2) of X genes that escape inactivation, and (3) of parentally imprinted
    X genes. Sex differences in phenotype are ultimately the result of multiple, independent
    sex-biasing factors, hormonal and sex chromosomal. These factors act in parallel
    and in combination to induce sex differences. They also can offset each other
    to reduce sex differences. Other mechanisms, operating at the level of populations,
    cause groups of males to differ on average from groups of females. The theory
    frames questions for further study, and directs attention to inherent sex-biasing
    factors that operate in many tissues to cause sex differences, and to cause sex-biased
    protection from disease. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: There are inherent biological differences between males and females that
    contribute to sex differences in brain function and to many sex-specific illnesses
    and disorders. Traditionally, it has been thought that such differences are due
    largely to hormonal regulation; however, there are also genetic and epigenetic
    effects caused by the inheritance and unequal dosage of genes located on the X
    and Y chromosomes. Here we discuss the evidence in favor of a genetic and epigenetic
    basis for sexually dimorphic behavior, as a consequence of underlying differences
    in the regulation of genes that drive brain function. A better understanding of
    sex-specific molecular processes in the brain will provide further insight for
    the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neuropsychiatric
    disorders characterized by sex differences. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '311-319'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: The X chromosome has played a critical role in the development of sexually
    selected characteristics for over 300 million years, and during that time it has
    accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions.
    There are relatively specific effects of X-linked genes on social cognition, language,
    emotional regulation, visuospatial, and numerical skills. Many human X-linked
    genes outside the X–Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X-inactivation. Dosage
    differences in the expression of such genes (which constitute at least 15% of
    the total) are likely to play an important role in male–female neural differentiation,
    and in cognitive deficits and behavioral characteristics, particularly in the
    realm of social communication, that are associated with sex chromosome aneuploidies.

  abstract: Responses to stress may be important in understanding gender differences
    in substance use disorders and may also be a target for development of treatment
    interventions. A growing body of both preclinical and clinical research supports
    important underlying gender differences in the corticotropin-releasing factor
    (CRF) and noradrenergic systems, which may contribute to drug use. Preclinical
    models have demonstrated increased sensitivity of females to CRF and noradrenergic-induced
    drug reinstatement compared with males, and, consistent with these findings, human
    laboratory studies have demonstrated greater sensitivity to corticotropin-releasing
    hormone (CRH) and noradrenergic stimulation in cocaine-dependent women compared
    with men. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated increased neural
    response to stressful stimuli in cocaine-dependent women compared with men as
    well as showing significant sex differences in the sensitivity of brain regions
    responsible for regulating the response to CRH. Development of interventions targeting
    the noradrenergic system and stress response in drug-dependent individuals could
    have important clinical implications for both women and men. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

  title: Sex differences in brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling and functions
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '328-335'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin
    family that plays a critical role in numerous neuronal activities. Recent studies
    have indicated that some functions or action mechanisms of BDNF vary in a sex-dependent
    manner. In particular, BDNF content in some brain parts and the tendency to develop
    BDNF deficiency-related diseases such as depression are greater in female animals.
    With the support of relevant studies, it has been suggested that sex hormones
    or steroids can modulate the activities of BDNF, which may account for its functional
    discrepancy in different sexes. Indeed, the cross-talk between BDNF and sex steroids
    has been detected for decades, and some sex steroids, such as estrogen, have a
    positive regulatory effect on BDNF expression and signaling. Thus, the sex of
    animal models that are used in studying the functions of BDNF is critical. This
    Mini-Review summarizes our current findings on the differences in expression,
    signaling, and functions of BDNF between sexes. We also discuss the potential
    mechanisms for mediating these differential responses, with a specific emphasis
    on sex steroids. By presenting and discussing these findings, we seek to encourage
    researchers to take sex influences into consideration when designing experiments,
    interpreting results, and drawing conclusions. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates diverse processes such
    as neuronal survival, differentiation, and plasticity. Accumulating evidence suggests
    that molecular events that direct sexual differentiation of the brain interact
    with BDNF signaling pathways. This Mini-Review first examines potential hormonal
    and epigenetic mechanisms through which sex influences BDNF signaling. We then
    examine how sex-specific regulation of BDNF signaling supports the development
    and function of sexually dimorphic neural circuits that underlie male-specific
    genital reflexes in rats and song production in birds. Finally, we discuss the
    implications of sex differences in BDNF signaling for gender-biased presentation
    of neurological and psychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Although
    this Mini-Review focuses on BDNF, we try to convey the general message that sex
    influences brain functions in complex ways and underscore the requirement for
    and challenge of expanding research on sex differences in neuroscience. 2016 Wiley

  title: Sex differences and estrogen regulation of BDNF gene expression, but not
    propeptide content, in the developing hippocampus
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '345-354'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Sex differences in adult brain function are frequently determined developmentally
    through the actions of steroid hormones during sensitive periods of prenatal and
    early postnatal life. In rodents, various cellular end points of the developing
    brain are affected by estradiol that is derived from the aromatization of circulating
    testosterone and/or synthesized within the brain. We have previously described
    a sex difference in neurogenesis in the hippocampus of neonatal rats that is modulated
    by estradiol. In this report, we examined a potential downstream regulator of
    the effects of estradiol on hippocampal cell proliferation by measuring gene expression
    of brain-derived neurotrophin (BDNF) in male and female neonatal rats in response
    to estradiol. Males had higher baseline BDNF gene expression in dentate gyrus
    and CA1 regions of the hippocampus compared with females. Neonatal administration
    of exogenous estradiol resulted in opposite effects on BDNF expression in these
    areas of the neonatal hippocampus, such that BDNF transcripts increased in CA1
    but decreased in dentate. Blocking endogenous estradiol signaling by antagonizing
    estrogen receptors decreased BDNF expression in the dentate of males, but not
    females, and had no effect in CA1. Interestingly, this sex difference and response
    to estradiol was not mirrored by translational output, as no differences in BDNF
    precursor peptide were observed. The sex- and region-specific effects of estradiol
    on BDNF expression in the neonatal hippocampus suggest a complex functional relationship
    between these pleiotropic factors in regulating developmental neurogenesis. 2016

    in brain development and functions
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '355-361'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Sexual selection describes the reproductive dynamics that drive the evolution
    of many sex differences but is rarely used to guide the study of brain development
    or function. This Mini-Review describes how these dynamics can result in trait
    elaboration in one sex or the other and why these traits have a heightened sensitivity
    to stressors. The framework provides a conceptual model that will help to organize
    what we know about sex differences in brain and cognition, a means to focus the
    search for additional sex differences, and a means to predict brain systems that
    are particularly vulnerable to disruption by exposure to stressors. This Mini-Review
    briefly illustrates these points using sex differences in birdsong and spatial
    navigation to highlight the benefits and the nuances of using evolutionary theory
    to help frame neuroscience studies of sex differences. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract: This Mini-Review describes sex differences in 66 quantitative characteristics
    of the brain and body measured in a community-based sample of 1,024 adolescents
    12–18 years of age, members of the Saguenay Youth Study. Using an extensive phenotyping
    protocol, we have obtained measures in a number of domains, including brain structure,
    cognition, mental health, substance use, body composition, metabolism, cardiovascular
    reactivity, and life style. For each measure, we provide estimates of effect size
    (Cohen’s d) and sex-specific correlations with age (Pearson R). In total 59 of
    the 66 characteristics showed sex differences (at a nominal P&lt;0.05), with small
    (32), medium-sized (13), and large (11) effects. Some, but not all, of these sex
    differences increase during adolescence; this appears to be the case mostly for
    anatomical and physiological measures. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '371-379'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Sex differences in brain development and aging are important to identify,
    as they may help to understand risk factors and outcomes in brain disorders that
    are more prevalent in one sex compared with the other. Brain imaging techniques
    have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding detailed structural and functional
    maps of the living brain. Even so, studies are often limited in sample size, and
    inconsistent findings emerge, one example being varying findings regarding sex
    differences in the size of the corpus callosum. More recently, large-scale neuroimaging
    consortia such as the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis Consortium
    have formed, pooling together expertise, data, and resources from hundreds of
    institutions around the world to ensure adequate power and reproducibility. These
    initiatives are helping us to better understand how brain structure is affected
    by development, disease, and potential modulators of these effects, including
    sex. This review highlights some established and disputed sex differences in brain
    structure across the life span, as well as pitfalls related to interpreting sex
    differences in health and disease. We also describe sex-related findings from
    the ENIGMA consortium, and ongoing efforts to better understand sex differences
    in brain circuitry. 2016 The Authors. Journal of Neuroscience Research Published

  title: 'Imaging sex/gender and autism in the brain: Etiological implications'
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '380-397'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: The male preponderance in autism prevalence has brought together the disparate
    topics of sex/gender and autism research. Two directions of neuroimaging studies
    on the relationships between sex/gender and autism may inform male-specific risk
    mechanisms and female-specific protective mechanisms of autism. First, we review
    how sex/gender moderates autism-related brain changes and how this informs general
    models of autism etiology. Better-powered human neuroimaging studies suggest that
    the brain characteristics of autism are qualitatively, rather than simply quantitatively,
    different between males and females. However, age and comorbidities might substantially
    moderate the pattern of differences. Second, we review how the relationship between
    autism-related brain changes (separately in males and females) and normative brain
    sex/gender differences informs specific etiological–developmental mechanisms.
    Both human and animal studies converge to indicate that the brain characteristics
    of autism are partly associated with normative brain sex/gender differences, suggesting
    convergence or overlap between the mechanisms leading to and modifying the development
    of autism and the mechanisms underlying sex differentiation and/or gender socialization.
    Future animal work needs to investigate sex differences in rodent mutants modeling
    autism-relevant genes and environmental exposures. Future human work needs to
    address the substantial phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity of autism and
    to focus on longitudinal neuroimaging studies (from early development) on the
    developmental trajectories of sex/gender-differential neural characteristics of
    autism. Combining animal and human work links up the causal chain from etiological
    factors, brain and physical development, to phenotypes. These together help delineate
    the different roles of sex and gender in relation to risk vs. protective mechanisms.

  title: Sex-specific effects of the Huntington gene on normal neurodevelopment
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '398-408'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: 'Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gene
    (HTT) with a unique feature of trinucleotide repeats ranging from 10 to 35 in
    healthy people; when expanded beyond 39 repeats, Huntington disease develops.
    Animal models demonstrate that HTT is vital to brain development; however, this
    has not been studied in humans. Moreover, evidence suggests that triplet repeat
    genes may have been vital in evolution of the human brain. Here we evaluate brain
    structure using magnetic resonance imaging and brain function using cognitive
    tests in a sample of school-aged children ages 6 to 18 years old. DNA samples
    were processed to quantify the number of CAG repeats within HTT. We find that
    the number of repeats in HTT, below disease threshold, confers advantageous changes
    in brain structure and general intelligence (IQ): the higher the number of repeats,
    the greater the change in brain structure, and the higher the IQ. The pattern
    of structural brain changes associated with HTT is strikingly different between
    males and females. HTT may confer an advantage or a disadvantage depending on
    the repeat length, playing a key role in either the evolution of a superior human
    brain or development of a uniquely human brain disease. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

  title: Sex-dependent consequences of neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia in the rat
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '409-421'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is an important cause of neurological deficits
    in humans, and the Levine-Rice model of experimental HI in the rat mimics the
    human brain lesion and the following sensory motor deficits and cognitive disabilities.
    With the growing evidence that sex influences all levels of brain functions, this
    Mini-Review highlights studies in which sex was a controlled variable and that
    provided evidence of sexual dimorphism in behavioral outcome, extension of brain
    damage, mechanisms of lesion, and treatment efficacy in the rat neonatal HI model.
    It was shown that 1) females have greater memory deficits; 2) cell death is dependent
    mainly on caspase activation in females; 3) males are more susceptible to oxidative
    stress; and 4) treatments acting on distinct cell death pathways afford sex-dependent
    neuroprotection. These tentative conclusions, along with growing evidence from
    other fields of neurobiology, support the need for scientists to design their
    experiments considering sex as an important variable; otherwise, important knowledge
    will continue to be missed. It is conceivable that sex can influence the development
    of efficacious therapeutic tools to treat neonates suffering from brain HI. 2016

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '422-436'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: The use of tobacco products represents a major public health concern,
    especially among women. Epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated that
    women have less success quitting tobacco use and a higher risk for developing
    tobacco-related diseases. The deleterious effects of nicotine are not restricted
    to adulthood, as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate critical aspects of
    neural development. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the particular sensitivity
    of women to develop tobacco dependence have not been well elucidated. In this
    mini-review, we show that gonadal hormone-mediated sexual differentiation of the
    brain may be an important determinant of sex differences in the effects of nicotine.
    We highlight direct interactions between sex steroid hormones and ligand-gated
    ion channels critical for brain maturation, and discuss the extended and profound
    sexual differentiation of the brain. We emphasize that nicotine exposure during
    the perinatal and adolescent periods interferes with normal sexual differentiation
    and can induce long-lasting, sex-dependent alterations in neuronal structure,
    cognitive and executive function, learning and memory, and reward processing.
    We stress important age and sex differences in nicotine’s effects and emphasize
    the importance of including these factors in preclinical research that models
    tobacco dependence. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '437-446'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United
    States. It is known that males and females respond differently to stroke. Depending
    on age, the incidence, prevalence, mortality rate, and disability outcome of stroke
    differ between the sexes. Females generally have strokes at older ages than males
    and, therefore, have a worse stroke outcome. There are also major differences
    in how the sexes respond to stroke at the cellular level. Immune response is a
    critical factor in determining the progress of neurodegeneration after stroke
    and is fundamentally different for males and females. Additionally, females respond
    to stroke therapies differently from males, yet they are often left out of the
    basic research that is focused on developing those therapies. With a resounding
    failure to translate stroke therapies from the bench to the bedside, it is clearer
    than ever that inclusion of both sexes in stroke studies is essential for future
    clinical success. This Mini-Review examines sex differences in the immune response
    to experimental stroke and its implications for therapy development. 2016 Wiley

    development
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '447-461'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Sexual differentiation of the brain occurs early in life as a result of
    sex-typical hormone action and sex chromosome effects. Immunocompetent cells are
    being recognized as underappreciated regulators of sex differences in brain and
    behavioral development, including microglia, astrocytes, and possibly other less
    well studied cell types, including T cells and mast cells. Immunocompetent cells
    in the brain are responsive to steroid hormones, but their role in sex-specific
    brain development is an emerging field of interest. This Review presents a summary
    of what is currently known about sex differences in the number, morphology, and
    signaling profile of immune cells in the developing brain and their role in the
    early-life programming of sex differences in brain and behavior. We review what
    is currently known about sex differences in the response to early-life perturbations,
    including stress, inflammation, diet, and environmental pollutants. We also discuss
    how and why understanding sex differences in the developing neuroimmune environment
    may provide insight into understanding the etiology of several neurodevelopmental
    disorders. This Review also highlights what remains to be discovered in this emerging
    field of developmental neuroimmunology and underscores the importance of filling
    in these knowledge gaps. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '462-471'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Stroke is not only a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide
    it also disproportionally affects women. There are currently over 500,000 more
    women stroke survivors in the US than men, and elderly women bear the brunt of
    stroke-related disability. Stroke has dropped to the fifth leading cause of death
    in men, but remains the third in women. This review discusses sex differences
    in common stroke risk factors, the efficacy of stroke prevention therapies, acute
    treatment responses, and post-stroke recovery in clinical populations. Women have
    an increased lifetime risk of stroke compared to men, largely due to a steep increase
    in stroke incidence in older postmenopausal women, yet most basic science studies
    continue to only evaluate young male animals. Women also have an increased lifetime
    prevalence of many common stroke risk factors, including hypertension and atrial
    fibrillation, as well as abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome. None of these
    age-related risk factors have been well modeled in the laboratory. Evidence from
    the bench has implicated genetic and epigenetic factors, differential activation
    of cell-death programs, cell-cell signaling pathways, and systemic immune responses
    as contributors to sex differences in ischemic stroke. The most recent basic scientific
    findings have been summarized in this review, with an emphasis on factors that
    differ between males and females that are pertinent to stroke outcomes. Identification
    and understanding of the underlying biological factors that contribute to sex
    differences will be critical to the development of translational targets to improve
    the treatment of women after stroke. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: The neuroimmune system is significantly sexually dimorphic, with sex differences
    evident in the number and activation states of microglia, in the activation of
    astrocytes, and in cytokine release and function. Neuroimmune cells and signaling
    are now recognized as critical for many neural functions throughout the life span,
    including synaptic plasticity and memory function. Here we address the question
    of how cytokines, astrocytes, and microglia contribute to memory, and specifically
    how neuroimmune modulation of memory differentially affects males and females.
    Understanding sex differences in both normal memory processes and dysregulation
    of memory in psychiatric and neurological disorders is critical for developing
    treatment and preventive strategies for memory disorders that are effective for
    both men and women. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Sex differences in innate immunity and its impact on opioid pharmacology
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '487-499'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Morphine has been and continues to be one of the most potent and widely
    used drugs for the treatment of pain. Clinical and animal models investigating
    sex differences in pain and analgesia demonstrate that morphine is a more potent
    analgesic in males than in females. In addition to binding to the neuronal $\mu$-opioid
    receptor, morphine binds to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
    located on glial cells. Activation of glial TLR4 initiates a neuroinflammatory
    response that directly opposes morphine analgesia. Females of many species have
    a more active immune system than males; however, few studies have investigated
    glial cells as a potential mechanism driving sexually dimorphic responses to morphine.
    This Mini-Review illustrates the involvement of glial cells in key processes underlying
    observed sex differences in morphine analgesia and suggests that targeting glia
    may improve current treatment strategies for pain. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Differences in the prevalence of chronic pain in women vs. men are well
    known, and decades of laboratory experimentation have demonstrated that women
    are more sensitive to pain than are men. Attention has thus shifted to investigating
    mechanisms underlying such differences. Recent evidence suggests that neuroimmune
    modulation of pain may represent an important cause of sex differences. The current
    Review examines the evidence for gonadal hormone modulation of the immune system,
    immune system modulation of pain, and interactions that might help to explain
    sex differences in pain. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Do microglia play a role in sex differences in TBI?
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '509-517'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity
    and mortality for both males and females and is, thus, a major focus of current
    study. Although the overall death rate of TBI for males is roughly three times
    higher than that for females, males have been disproportionately represented in
    clinical and preclinical studies. Gender differences are known to exist in many
    neurologic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and stroke, and differences appear
    to exist in TBI. Furthermore, it is known that microglia have sexually dimorphic
    roles in CNS development and other neurologic conditions; however, most animal
    studies of microglia and TBI have focused on male subjects. Microglia are a current
    target of many preclinical and clinical therapeutic trials for TBI. Understanding
    the relationship among sex, sex hormones, and microglia is critical to truly understanding
    the pathophysiology of TBI. However, the evidence for sex differences in TBI centers
    mainly on sex hormones, and evidenced-based conclusions are often contradictory.
    In an attempt to review the current literature, it is apparent that sex differences
    likely exist, but the contradictory nature and magnitude of such differences in
    the existing literature does not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, except
    that more investigation of this issue is necessary. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Do cortical plasticity mechanisms differ between males and females?
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '518-526'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: The difference between male and female behavior and male and female susceptibility
    to a number of neuropsychiatric conditions is not controversial. From a biological
    perspective, one might expect to see at least some of these differences underpinned
    by identifiable physical differences in the brain. This Mini-Review focuses on
    evidence that plasticity mechanisms differ between males and females and ask at
    what scale of organization the differences might exist, at the systems level,
    the circuits level, or the synaptic level. Emerging evidence suggests that plasticity
    differences may extend to the scale of synaptic mechanisms. In particular, the
    CaMKK, NOS1 and estrogen receptor pathways show sexual dimorphisms with implications
    for plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. 2016 The Authors. Journal

  title: Sexual modulation of sex-shared neurons and circuits in Caenorhabditis elegans
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '527-538'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: 'Studies using the nematode C. elegans have provided unique insights
    into the development and function of sex differences in the nervous system. Enabled
    by the relative simplicity of this species, comprehensive studies have solved
    the complete cellular neuroanatomy of both sexes as well as the complete neural
    connectomes of the entire adult hermaphrodite and the adult male tail. This work,
    together with detailed behavioral studies, has revealed three aspects of sex differences
    in the nervous system: sex-specific neurons and circuits; circuits with sexually
    dimorphic synaptic connectivity; and sex differences in the physiology and functions
    of shared neurons and circuits. At all of these levels, biological sex influences
    neural development and function through the activity of a well-defined genetic
    hierarchy that acts throughout the body to translate chromosomal sex into the
    state of a master autosomal regulator of sexual differentiation, the transcription
    factor TRA-1A. This Review focuses on the role of genetic sex in implementing
    sex differences in shared neurons and circuits, with an emphasis on linking the
    sexual modulation of specific neural properties to the specification and optimization
    of sexually divergent and dimorphic behaviors. An important and unexpected finding
    from these studies is that chemosensory neurons are a primary focus of sexual
    modulation, with genetic sex adaptively shaping chemosensory repertoire to guide
    behavioral choice. Importantly, hormone-independent functions of genetic sex are
    the principal drivers of all of these sex differences, making nematodes an excellent
    model for understanding similar but poorly understood mechanisms that likely act
    throughout the animal kingdom. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'

  abstract: Sex differences in the function of the hippocampus have been observed
    in numerous mammalian species. However, the magnitude, extent, and specificity
    of these differences are unclear because they can depend on factors including
    age, methodology, and environment. This Review will discuss seminal studies examining
    sex differences in hippocampal memory, neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity,
    and cell signaling in humans and rodents. We also describe possible organizational
    and activational effects of sex steroid hormones during early development, puberty,
    and adulthood that may lead to sex differences observed in the hippocampus. We
    conclude by discussing the implications of sex differences in hippocampal function
    for mental health. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Sex differences in hippocampal area CA3 pyramidal cells
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '563-575'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated differences between males and females
    in hippocampal structure, function, and plasticity. There also are many studies
    about the different predisposition of a males and females for disorders where
    the hippocampus plays an important role. Many of these reports focus on area CA1,
    but other subfields are also very important, and unlikely to be the same as area
    CA1 based on what is known. Here we review basic studies of male and female structure,
    function, and plasticity of area CA3 pyramidal cells of adult rats. The data suggest
    that the CA3 pyramidal cells of males and females are distinct in structure, function,
    and plasticity. These sex differences cannot be simply explained by the effects
    of circulating gonadal hormones. This view agrees with previous studies showing
    that there are substantial sex differences in the brain that cannot be normalized
    by removing the gonads and depleting peripheral gonadal hormones. Implications
    of these comparisons for understanding sex differences in hippocampal function
    and dysfunction are discussed. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Sex differences in associations of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin with
    resting-state functional brain connectivity
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '576-586'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) exert robust and sexually
    dimorphic influences on cognition and emotion. How these hormones regulate relevant
    functional brain systems is not well understood. OT and AVP serum concentrations
    were assayed in 60 healthy individuals (36 women). Brain functional networks assessed
    with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were constructed
    with graph theory–based approaches that characterize brain networks as connected
    nodes. Sex differences were demonstrated in rs-fMRI. Men showed higher nodal degree
    (connectedness) and efficiency (information propagation capacity) in left inferior
    frontal gyrus (IFG) and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and higher nodal
    degree in left rolandic operculum. Women showed higher nodal betweenness (being
    part of paths between nodes) in right putamen and left inferior parietal gyrus
    (IPG). Higher hormone levels were associated with less intrinsic connectivity.
    In men, higher AVP was associated with lower nodal degree and efficiency in left
    IFG (pars orbitalis) and left STG and less efficiency in left IFG (pars triangularis).
    In women, higher AVP was associated with lower betweenness in left IPG, and higher
    OT was associated with lower nodal degree in left IFG (pars orbitalis). Hormones
    differentially correlate with brain networks that are important for emotion processing
    and cognition in men and women. AVP in men and OT in women may regulate orbital
    frontal cortex connectivity, which is important in emotion processing. Hormone
    associations with STG and pars triangularis in men and parietal cortex in women
    may account for well-established sex differences in verbal and visuospatial abilities,
    respectively. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Migraine is a common neurological disorder with significantly higher incidence
    and prevalence in women than men. The presentation of the disease in women is
    modulated by changes in sex hormones from adolescence to pregnancy and menopause.
    Yet, the effect of sex influences has often been neglected in both basic and clinical
    and in clinical management of the disease. In this review, evidence from epidemiological,
    clinical, animal, and neuroimaging studies on the significance of the sex-related
    influences in migraine is presented, and the unmet needs in each area are discussed.

  title: Contributory role of sex differences in the variations of gustatory function
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '594-603'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Remarkable variability between males and females occurs for an array of
    taste-guided behaviors in both rodents and humans. Sex differences have been noted
    for taste preference, detection thresholds, and reactivity to taste stimuli. Manipulating
    sex hormones during early postnatal development or altering the amount of circulating
    estrogen in adulthood can dramatically alter the pattern of these behaviors. Receptors
    for sex hormones appear to be prominent in several nuclei associated with central
    gustatory pathways, indicating that steroid hormones may modulate central taste
    processing. Electrophysiological recordings from the rat brainstem suggest that
    taste-elicited activity to sweet stimuli is organized by hormones during early
    development, and activity during bitter stimulation is altered by circulating
    ovarian hormones. Sex differences in gustatory function appear to emerge at the
    level of the taste bud. Among ovariectomized rats, estradiol treatment decreases
    activity in the chorda tympani nerve during NaCl stimulation. Although there is
    no evidence that chorda tympani responses to NaCl differ between intact male and
    female rats, glossopharyngeal nerve responses are lower in intact females for
    both NaCl and sodium acetate. Responses in the glossopharyngeal nerve to citric
    acid stimulation are also higher in female rats relative to males. These findings
    suggest that, in addition to differential central modulation of taste input based
    on sex, taste information from the periphery varies between males and females.
    Although the extent of sex differences in taste processing and the underlying
    causal mechanisms require further clarification, it is clear that studying one
    sex alone provides an incomplete picture of gustatory function. 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

  title: Sex-based differences in brain alterations across chronic pain conditions
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '604-616'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: 'Common brain mechanisms are thought to play a significant role across
    a multitude of chronic pain syndromes. In addition, there is strong evidence for
    the existence of sex differences in the prevalence of chronic pain and in the
    neurobiology of pain. Thus, it is important to consider sex when developing general
    principals of pain neurobiology. The goal of the current Mini-Review is to evaluate
    what is known about sex-specific brain alterations across multiple chronic pain
    populations. A total of 15 sex difference and 143 single-sex articles were identified
    from among 412 chronic pain neuroimaging articles. Results from sex difference
    studies indicate more prominent primary sensorimotor structural and functional
    alterations in female chronic pain patients compared with male chronic pain patients:
    differences in the nature and degree of insula alterations, with greater insula
    reactivity in male patients; differences in the degree of anterior cingulate structural
    alterations; and differences in emotional-arousal reactivity. Qualitative comparisons
    of male-specific and female-specific studies appear to be consistent with the
    results from sex difference studies. Given these differences, mixed-sex studies
    of chronic pain risk creating biased data or missing important information and
    single-sex studies have limited generalizability. The advent of large-scale neuroimaging
    databases will likely aid in building a more comprehensive understanding of sex
    differences and commonalities in brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain. 2016

  abstract: This Mini-Review summarizes a wide range of sex differences in the human
    visual system, with a primary focus on sex differences in visual perception and
    its neural basis. We highlight sex differences in both basic and high-level visual
    processing, with evidence from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging
    studies. We argue that sex differences in human visual processing, no matter how
    small or subtle, support the view that females and males truly see the world differently.
    We acknowledge some of the controversy regarding sex differences in human vision
    and propose that such controversy should be interpreted as a source of motivation
    for continued efforts to assess the validity and reliability of published sex
    differences and for continued research on sex differences in human vision and
    the nervous system in general. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '626-632'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Although a sexual dimorphism in brain structure is generally well established,
    evidence for sex differences in Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45 is inconclusive.
    This may be due to the difficulty of accurately defining BA 44 and BA 45 in magnetic
    resonance images, given that these regions are variable in their location and
    extent and that they do not match well with macroanatomic landmarks. Here we set
    out to test for possible sex differences in the local gray matter of BA 44/45
    by integrating imaging-based signal intensities with cytoarchitectonically defined
    tissue probabilities in a sample of 50 male and 50 female subjects. In addition
    to testing for sex differences with respect to left- and right-hemispheric measures
    of BA 44/45, we also assessed possible sex differences in BA 44/45 asymmetry.
    Our analyses revealed significantly larger gray matter volumes in females compared
    with males for BA 44 and BA 45 bilaterally. However, there was a lack of significant
    sex differences in BA 44/45 asymmetry. These results corroborate reports of a
    language-related female superiority, particularly with respect to verbal fluency
    and verbal memory tasks. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research

  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: To date, scientific research has often focused on one sex, with assumptions
    that study of the other sex would yield similar results. However, many diseases
    affect males and females differently. The sex of a patient can affect the risk
    for both disease susceptibility and progression. Such differences can be brought
    to the laboratory bench to be investigated, potentially bringing new treatments
    back to the clinic. This method of research, known as a “bedside to bench to bedside”
    approach, has been applied to studying sex differences in multiple sclerosis (MS).
    Females have greater susceptibly to MS, while males have worse disease progression.
    These two characteristics of the disease are influenced by the immune system and
    the nervous system, respectively. Thus, sex differences in each system must be
    studied. Personalized medicine has been at the forefront of research recently,
    and studying sex differences in disease fits with this initiative. This review
    will discuss the known sex differences in MS and highlight how investigating them
    can lead to new insights and potential treatments for both men and women. 2016

  abstract: We performed comparative analyses of the genotype distribution and allelic
    frequencies of the rs948854 polymorphism (G/A) in the galanin gene’s promoter
    in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in healthy matched controls. In total
    111 patients and 115 control subjects were included. The analyses revealed that
    the presence of the minor allele (G) increased susceptibility to MS in men (OR=2.49,
    P=0.008) but not in women. The presence of the G allele in men was also significantly
    associated with the late onset of MS. Furthermore, rs948854 polymorphism affected
    the rate of MS progression depending on the sex of the patients. In woman (typically
    slowly progressing), the percentage of patients with the slow (&lt;0.5 EDSS score
    per year) progression rate was significantly reduced ($\chi$2=5.7, P=0.017) in
    the minor allele carriers group (52.6%), in comparison with the wild-type carriers
    (83.9%). In men (typically quickly progressing), the number of patients with fast
    progression rate (≥0.75 EDSS score per year) tended to increase in the minor allele
    carriers group (50%) compared with number of patients with the wild-type carriers

    polymorphism and multiple sclerosis and, further, that this association is sex
    specific. They also point to diagnostic and prognostic benefits of genetic screening
    of patients with multiple sclerosis. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Sexual divergence in activity-dependent neuroprotective protein impacting
    autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '652-660'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Discovered in our laboratory, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
    (ADNP) interacts with key regulatory proteins, including the chromatin remodeling
    complex SWI/SNF, proteins associated with RNA splicing, RNA translation, microtubule
    dynamics, and autophagy. ADNP regulates&gt;400 genes during mouse embryonic development
    and is essential for neural tube closure. ADNP key functions extend from mice
    to men, with mutations causing ADNP-related ID/autism syndrome, also known as
    the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. ADNP mRNA increases in lymphocytes derived
    from schizophrenia patients and in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment
    (MCI) and further increases in Alzheimer’s disease patients compared with controls.
    Serum ADNP levels correlate with IQ. NAP (davunetide), an ADNP snippet drug candidate,
    protects cognition in patients suffering from amnestic MCI preceding Alzheimer’s
    disease and significantly enhances functional daily activities in schizophrenia
    patients toward future development. It is important to note that ADNP is sexually
    regulated in the brains of birds, mice, and men and in lymphocytes of patients
    suffering from schizophrenia. ADNP haploinsufficiency in mice results in significantly
    decreased axonal transport (with male–female differences) changes in gene expression
    in a sex-dependent manner, including key regulatory mechanisms during brain and
    heart development and function and behavioral outcomes. These findings pave the
    path for better understanding of brain function through the prism of sex differences.

  title: Sex differences in the anticonvulsant activity of neurosteroids
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '661-670'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Epilepsy is one of the leading causes of chronic neurological morbidity
    worldwide. Acquired epilepsy may result from a number of conditions, such as brain
    injury, anoxia, tumors, stroke, neurotoxicity, and prolonged seizures. Sex differences
    have been observed in many seizure types; however, some sex-specific seizure disorders
    are much more prevalent in women. Despite some inconsistencies, substantial data
    indicates that sensitivity to seizure stimuli differs between the sexes. Men generally
    exhibit greater seizure susceptibility than women, whereas many women with epilepsy
    experience a cyclical occurrence of seizures that tends to center around the menstrual
    period, which has been termed catamenial epilepsy. Some epilepsy syndromes show
    gender differences with female predominance or male predominance. Steroid hormones,
    endogenous neurosteroids, and sexually dimorphic neural networks appear to play
    a key role in sex differences in seizure susceptibility. Neurosteroids, such as
    allopregnanolone, reflect sex differences in their anticonvulsant activity. This
    Review provides a brief overview of the evidence for sex differences in epilepsy
    and how sex differences influence the use of neurosteroids in epilepsy and epileptogenesis.

  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Men and women exhibit differences in the development and progression of
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The factors underlying the sex differences in AD are
    not well understood. This Review emphasizes the contributions of sex steroid hormones
    to the relationship between sex and AD. In women, events that decrease lifetime
    exposure to estrogens are generally associated with increased AD risk, whereas
    estrogen-based hormone therapy administered near the time of menopause may reduce
    AD risk. In men, estrogens do not exhibit age-related reduction and are not significantly
    associated with AD risk. Rather, normal age-related depletions of testosterone
    in plasma and brain predict enhanced vulnerability to AD. Both estrogens and androgens
    exert numerous protective actions in the adult brain that increase neural functioning
    and resilience as well as specifically attenuating multiple aspects of AD-related
    neuropathology. Aging diminishes the activational effects of sex hormones in sex-specific
    manners, which is hypothesized to contribute to the relationship between aging
    and AD. Sex steroid hormones may also drive sex differences in AD through their
    organizational effects during developmental sexual differentiation of the brain.
    Specifically, sex hormone actions during early development may confer inherent
    vulnerability of the female brain to development of AD in advanced age. The combined
    effects of organizational and activational effects of sex steroids yield distinct
    sex differences in AD pathogenesis, a significant variable that must be more rigorously
    considered in future research. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  page: '681-691'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and acquired disability in
    aged populations. Women are disproportionally affected by stroke, having a higher
    incidence and worse outcomes than men. Numerous preclinical studies have discovered
    novel therapies for the treatment of stroke, but almost all of these have been
    shown to be unsuccessful in clinical trials. Despite known sex differences in
    occurrence and severity of stroke, few preclinical or clinical therapeutics take
    into account possible sex differences in treatment. Reanalysis of data from studies
    of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only currently FDA-approved stroke
    therapy, has shown that tPA improves stroke outcomes for both sexes and also shows
    sexual dimorphism by more robust improvement in stroke outcome in females. Experimental
    evidence supports the inclusion of sex as a variable in the study of a number
    of novel stroke drugs and therapies, including preclinical studies of anti-inflammatory
    drugs (minocycline), stimulators of cell survival (insulin-like growth factor-1),
    and inhibitors of cell death pathways (pharmacological inhibition of poly\[ADP-ribose\]
    polymerase-1, nitric oxide production, and caspase activation) as well as in current
    clinical trials of stem cell therapy and cortical stimulation. Overall, study
    design and analysis in clinical trials as well as in preclinical studies must
    include both sexes equally, consider possible sex differences in the analyses,
    and report the differences/similarities in more systematic/structured ways to
    allow promising therapies for both sexes and increase stroke recovery. 2016 Wiley

  abstract: Epigenetics refers to potentially heritable processes that can mediate
    both lasting and transient changes in gene expression in the absence of genome
    sequence alterations. The field of epigenetics has introduced a novel understanding
    of the mechanisms through which the environment can shape an individual and potentially
    its offspring. This Mini-Review examines the current literature exploring the
    role of epigenetics in the development of mood disorders such as depression. Depression
    is twofold more common in females, yet the majority of preclinical research has
    been conducted exclusively in male subjects. Here we discuss what is known about
    sex differences in epigenetic regulation and function and how this may contribute
    to the etiology and onset of mood disorders. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    in healthy individuals: Implications for depression'
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '703-710'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Twice as many women as men suffer from mood and anxiety disorders, yet
    the biological underpinnings of this phenomenon have been understudied and remain
    unclear. We and others have shown that the hemodynamic response to subliminally
    presented sad or happy faces during functional MRI (fMRI) is a robust biomarker
    for the attentional bias toward negative information classically observed in major
    depression. Here we used fMRI to compare the performance of healthy females (n=28)
    and healthy males (n=28) on a backward masking task using a fast event-related
    design with gradient-recalled, echoplanar imaging with sensitivity encoding. The
    image data were compared across groups using a region-of-interest analysis with
    small-volume correction to control for multiple testing (Pcorrected&lt;0.05, cluster
    size≥20 voxels). Notably, compared with males, females showed greater BOLD activity
    in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the right hippocampus when
    viewing masked sad vs. masked happy faces. Furthermore, females displayed reduced
    BOLD activity in the right pregenual ACC and left amygdala when viewing masked
    happy vs. masked neutral faces. Given that we have previously reported similar
    findings for depressed participants compared with healthy controls (regardless
    of gender), our results raise the possibility that on average healthy females
    show subtle emotional processing biases that conceivably reflect a subgroup of
    women predisposed to depression. Nevertheless, we note that the differences between
    males and females were small and derived from region-of-interest rather than voxelwise
    analyses. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Do sex differences in rumination explain sex differences in depression?
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '711-718'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: It is generally accepted that women tend to ruminate more than men do
    and these thought patterns are often associated with depressive symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema
    et al., ). Based on these findings, we considered whether the relationship between
    rumination and depression is stronger in women than in men and if so, whether
    this might explain the higher prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in
    women and finally, whether the association can be disrupted through a mind/body
    intervention. Adult men and women, most of whom were clinically depressed, participated
    in an intervention known as MAP Training, which combines “mental” training with
    silent meditation and “physical” training with aerobic exercise (Shors et al.,
    ). After eight weeks of training, both men and women reported significantly fewer
    symptoms of depression and fewer ruminative thoughts (Alderman et al., ). Statistical
    correlations between depressive symptoms and ruminative thoughts were strong and
    significant (rho&gt;0.50; p&lt;0.05) for both men and women before and after MAP
    Training. However, only in women did depressive symptoms relate to “reflective”
    ruminations, which involve analyses of past events, feelings, and behaviors. This
    is also the only relationship that dissipated after the intervention. In general,
    these analyses suggest that the strength of the relationship between depressive
    symptoms and rumination does not necessarily explain sex differences in depression;
    but because the relationship is strong, targeting rumination through intervention
    can reduce the incidence of MDD, which is more prevalent among women. 2016 Wiley

  title: Sex differences in depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '719-730'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Women have a lifetime risk of major depression double that of men but
    only during their reproductive years. This sex difference has been attributed
    partially to activational effects of female sex steroids and also to the burdens
    of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. Men, in contrast, have a reproductive
    period difficult to delineate, and research on the mental health of men has rarely
    considered the effects of fatherhood. However, the couple goes through a number
    of potentially stressing events during the reproductive period, and both mothers
    and fathers are at risk of developing peripartum depression. This Review discusses
    the literature on maternal and paternal depression and the endocrine changes that
    may predispose a person to depression at this stage of life, with specific focus
    on the hypothalamus–pituitary axis, oxytocin, and testosterone levels in men.
    Important findings on sex differences in the neural correlates of maternal and
    paternal behavior have emerged, highlighting the relevance of the emotional brain
    in mothers and the sociocognitive brain in fathers and pointing toward the presence
    of a common parents’ brain. Additionally, sex differences in neurogenesis and
    brain plasticity are described in relation to peripartum depression. 2016 The

    Implications for clinical research'
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '731-736'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Women suffer from depression and anxiety disorders more often than men,
    and as a result they receive antidepressants to a greater extent. Sex differences
    in antidepressant response in humans have been modestly studied, and results have
    been controversial. At the same time, preclinical studies on animal models of
    depression and antidepressant response have provided insights with regard to sex
    differences that could be useful for the design and interpretation of future clinical
    trials. This Mini-Review discusses such sex-differentiated findings with regard
    to the presentation of depression, endophenotypes, and antidepressant response.
    In particular, men and women differ in symptomatology of depression, and animal
    models of depression have revealed sex differences in behavioral indices. However,
    although in experimental studies behavioral indices and models are adjusted to
    identify sex differences properly, this is not the case in the use of depression
    rating scales in clinical studies. Accordingly, preclinical studies highlight
    the importance of sex differences at the baseline behavioral response and the
    underlying mechanisms that often converge after antidepressant treatment. This
    is also a neglected issue in human studies. Finally, preclinical research suggests
    that, in the quest for potential biomarkers for depression, sex should be an important
    factor to consider. Careful consideration of sex differences in preclinical research
    could facilitate and ameliorate the design and quality of clinical studies for
    disease biomarkers and novel fast-acting antidepressants that are so essential
    for both men and women suffering from depression. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: Evaluating social defeat as a model for psychopathology in adult female rodents
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience Research
  page: '763-776'
  volume: '95'
  issue: '1-2'
  abstract: Social conflict is a predominant stressor in humans and is associated
    with increased risk for developing psychological illnesses including depression
    and anxiety. Overwhelmingly, more women suffer from these disorders, which may
    be due to increased stress sensitivity. Like humans, rodents experience a myriad
    of physiological and behavioral sequelae due to prolonged stress exposure. Although
    the motivation for social conflict may differ between humans and rodents, female
    rodents may provide an opportunity to explore the underlying mechanisms by which
    stress confers risk for psychopathology in women. Because most female rodents
    do not express spontaneous aggression, the majority of basic research examines
    the physiological and behavioral outcomes of social conflict in male rodents.
    However, there are instances where female rodents exhibit territorial (California
    mice and Syrian hamsters) and maternal aggression (rats, mice, and hamsters) creating
    a venue to examine sex differences in physiology and behavior in response to stress.
    While many studies rely upon nonsocial behavioral assays (e.g., elevated plus
    maze, forced swim test) to assess the impact of stress on emotionality, here we
    primarily focus on behavioral outcomes in social-based assays in rodents. This
    is critically important given that disruptions in social relationships can be
    a cause and consequence of neuropsychiatric diseases. Next, we briefly discuss
    how sex differences in the recruitment of neural circuitry and/or neurochemistry
    in response to stress may underlie sex differences in neuroendocrine and behavioral
    stress responses. Finally, the translational value of females in rodent stress
    models and considerations regarding behavioral interpretations of these models
    are discussed. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: 'Substance use disorders and mood disorders are highly comorbid and
    confer a high risk for adverse outcomes. However, data are limited on the neurodevelopmental
    basis of this comorbidity. Substance use initiation typically occurs during adolescence,
    and sex-specific developmental mechanisms are implicated. In this preliminary
    study, we review the literature and investigate regional gray matter volume (GMV)
    associated with subsequent substance use problems in adolescents with bipolar
    disorder (BD) and explore these associations for females and males. Thirty adolescents
    with DSM-IV–diagnosed BD and minimal alcohol/substance exposure completed baseline
    structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. At follow-up (on average 6 years
    post baseline), subjects were administered the CRAFFT interview and categorized
    into those scoring at high (≥2: CRAFFTHIGH) vs. low (&lt;2: CRAFFTLOW) risk for
    alcohol/substance problems. Lower GMV in prefrontal, insular, and temporopolar
    cortices were observed at baseline among adolescents with BD reporting subsequent
    alcohol and cannabis use compared to adolescents with BD who did not (P&lt;0.005,
    clusters≥20 voxels). Lower dorsolateral prefrontal GMV was associated with future
    substance use in both females and males. In females, lower orbitofrontal and insula
    GMV was associated with future substance use, while in males, lower rostral prefrontal
    GMV was associated with future use. Lower orbitofrontal, insular, and temporopolar
    GMV was observed in those who transitioned to smoking tobacco. Findings indicate
    that GMV development is associated with risk for future substance use problems
    in adolescents with BD, with results implicating GMV development in regions subserving
    emotional regulation in females and regions subserving executive processes and
    attention in males. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'

    in a sample of 949 youths (aged 8–22 y, 428 males and 521 females) and discovered
    unique sex differences in brain connectivity during the course of development.
    Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well as analysis of regional and global
    network measures, presented a comprehensive description of network characteristics.
    In all supratentorial regions, males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity,
    as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity, whereas between-hemispheric connectivity
    and cross-module participation predominated in females. However, this effect was
    reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis of these changes developmentally
    demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence
    and in adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that male brains are structured
    to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas
    female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and
    intuitive processing modes. '

  abstract: 'Next Section Abstract A number of studies have reported that, “relative to brain size,” the midsagittal corpus callosum cross-sectional area (CCA) in females is on average larger than in males. However, others suggest that these may be spurious differences created in the CCA-to-brain-size ratio because brain size tends to be larger in males. To help resolve this controversy, we measured the CCA on all 316 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of normal subjects (18–94 years) in the OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) cross-sectional dataset, and used multiple regression analysis to statistically control for the confounding effects of brain size and age to test the null hypothesis that the average CCA is not different between genders. An additional analysis was performed on a subset of 74 young adults (37 males and 37 females; 18–29 years) matched closely to brain size. Our null hypothesis was rejected in both analyses. In the entire sample (n= 316), controlling for brain size and age, the average CCA was significantly (P< 0.03) larger in females. The difference favoring females was more pronounced in the young adults cohort (P< 0.0005). These results provide strong additional evidence that the CCA is larger in females after correcting for the confounding effect of brain size.'

  title: Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships
    With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence
  container-title: American Journal of Public Health
  publisher: American Public Health Association
  page: '941-947'
  volume: '97'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'Objectives: We sought to examine the prevalence of reciprocal (i.e., perpetrated
    by both partners) and nonreciprocal intimate partner violence and to determine
    whether reciprocity is related to violence frequency and injury. Methods: We analyzed
    data on young US adults aged 18 to 28 years from the 2001 National Longitudinal
    Study of Adolescent Health, which contained information about partner violence
    and injury reported by 11 370 respondents on 18761 heterosexual relationships. Results:
    Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were
    reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the
    perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases. Reciprocity was associated with more
    frequent violence among women (adjusted odds ratio \[AOR\]=2.3; 95% confidence
    interval \[CI\]=1.9, 2.8), but not men (AOR=1.26; 95% CI=0.9, 1.7). Regarding
    injury, men were more likely to inflict injury than were women (AOR=1.3; 95% CI=1.1,
    1.5), and reciprocal intimate partner violence was associated with greater injury
    than was nonreciprocal intimate partner violence regardless of the gender of the
    perpetrator (AOR=4.4; 95% CI=3.6, 5.5). Conclusions: The context of the violence
    (reciprocal vs nonreciprocal) is a strong predictor of reported injury. Prevention
    approaches that address the escalation of partner violence may be needed to address
    reciprocal violence.'

  title: Political diversity will improve social psychological science
  publisher: Cambridge University Press
  publisher-place: New York, USA
  volume: '38'
  abstract: 'AbstractPsychologists have demonstrated the value of diversity – particularly
    diversity of viewpoints – for enhancing creativity, discovery, and problem solving.
    But one key type of viewpoint diversity is lacking in academic psychology in general
    and social psychology in particular: political diversity. This article reviews
    the available evidence and finds support for four claims: (1) Academic psychology
    once had considerable political diversity, but has lost nearly all of it in the
    last 50 years. (2) This lack of political diversity can undermine the validity
    of social psychological science via mechanisms such as the embedding of liberal
    values into research questions and methods, steering researchers away from important
    but politically unpalatable research topics, and producing conclusions that mischaracterize
    liberals and conservatives alike. (3) Increased political diversity would improve
    social psychological science by reducing the impact of bias mechanisms such as
    confirmation bias, and by empowering dissenting minorities to improve the quality
    of the majority’s thinking. (4) The underrepresentation of non-liberals in social
    psychology is most likely due to a combination of self-selection, hostile climate,
    and discrimination. We close with recommendations for increasing political diversity
    in social psychology.'

  title: Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal Cases
  URL: http://repository.law.umich.edu/law_econ_current/57
  abstract: 'This paper assesses gender disparities in federal criminal cases. It finds large gender gaps favoring women throughout the sentence length distribution (averaging over 60%), conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables. Female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. Prior studies have reported much smaller sentence gaps because they have ignored the role of charging, plea-bargaining, and sentencing fact-finding in producing sentences. Most studies control for endogenous severity measures that result from these earlier discretionary processes and use samples that have been winnowed by them. I avoid these problems by using a linked dataset tracing cases from arrest through sentencing. Using decomposition methods, I show that most sentence disparity arises from decisions at the earlier stages, and use the rich data to investigate causal theories for these gender gaps.'

  abstract: Meta-analyses of sex differences in physical aggression to heterosexual
    partners and in its physical consequences are reported. Women were slightly more
    likely (d=–.05) than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to
    use such acts more frequently. Men were more likely (d=.15) to inflict an injury,
    and overall, 62% of those injured by a partner were women. The findings partially
    support previous claims that different methods of measurement produce conflicting
    results, but there was also evidence that the sample was an important moderator
    of effect size. Continuous models showed that younger aged dating samples and
    a lower proportion of physically aggressive males predicted effect sizes in the
    female direction. Analyses were limited by the available database, which is biased
    toward young dating samples in the United States. Wider variations are discussed
    in terms of two conflicting norms about physical aggression to partners that operate
    to different degrees in different cultures.

  abstract: 'Of the 1.2 million migrants who arrived in Germany in 2014 and 2015, only 34,000 found work. Angela Merkel went to lay white roses at the scene of the Christmas market attack in Berlin. Thousands of Germans did the same. Many brought candles and cried. But anger and the will to combat the threat remained largely absent. Nothing better describes the present state of Germany than the sad fate of Maria Landenburger, a 19-year-old girl, murdered at the beginning of December. A member of a refugee relief organization, Landenburger was among those who welcomed migrants in 2015. She was raped and murdered by one of the people she was helping. Her family asked anyone who wanted to pay tribute to their daughter to give money to refugee associations, so that more refugees could come to Germany. The law that condemns incitement to hatred, presumably intended to prevent a return to Nazi ideas, is held like a sword over whoever speaks too harshly of the growing Islamization of the country. The great majority of the Germans do not want to see that Germany is at war, because a merciless enemy has declared war on them. They do not want to see that war has been declared on Western civilization. They accept defeat and docilely do what jihadists want them to do: they submit. If Angela Merkel does not see the difference between Jews exterminated by the Nazis, and Muslims threatening to exterminate Christians, Jews and other Muslims, she is even more clueless than it seems.'

  title: Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and
    achievement?
  container-title: Review of General Psychology
  publisher: Educational Publishing Foundation
  publisher-place: US
  page: '93-102'
  volume: '16'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Men and women score similarly in most areas of mathematics, but a gap
    favoring men is consistently found at the high end of performance. One explanation
    for this gap, stereotype threat, was first proposed by Spencer, Steele, and Quinn
    (1999) and has received much attention. We discuss merits and shortcomings of
    this study and review replication attempts. Only 55% of the articles with experimental
    designs that could have replicated the original results did so. But half of these
    were confounded by statistical adjustment of preexisting mathematics exam scores.
    Of the unconfounded experiments, only 30% replicated the original. A meta-analysis
    of these effects confirmed that only the group of studies with adjusted mathematics
    scores displayed the stereotype threat effect. We conclude that although stereotype
    threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support
    the current level of enthusiasm for this as a mechanism underlying the gender
    gap in mathematics. We argue there are many reasons to close this gap, and that
    too much weight on the stereotype explanation may hamper research and implementation
    of effective interventions.

  abstract: "Claude Steele’s stereotype threat hypothesis has attracted significant attention in recent years. This study tested one of the main tenets of his theory—that stereotype threat serves to increase individual anxiety levels, thus hurting performance—using real‐time measures of physiological arousal. Subjects were randomly assigned to either high or low stereotype threat conditions involving a challenging mathematics task while physiological measures of arousal were recorded. Results showed significant physiological reactance (skin conductance, skin temperature, blood pressure) as a function of a stereotype threat manipulation. These findings are consistent with the argument that stereotype threat manipulations either increase or decrease situational‐specific anxiety, and hold significant implications for thinking about fair assessment and testing practices in academic settings."

  container-title: Computers in Human Behavior

  volume: '27'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was developed in response to reports
    of low validity of explicit (self-report) measures of attitudes, stereotypes,
    and prejudices. Usually, people are unwilling to report what they think and feel
    about other races, groups, and nationalities. The IAT has been written about in
    many books, newspapers, journal articles, websites, and has been featured frequently
    on radio and television many times; its web site has now reached a peak of 5 million
    visits. However, despite this popularity its validity and particularly its reliability
    is under question. This article reports on the validity and reliability of the
    IAT. Four different experiments were conducted on 150 students at California State
    University, Long Beach to investigate the temporal reliability of IAT. Also students’
    opinion (trust) about the validity and reliability of the test was evaluated.
    The results showed that while there are numerous reports of moderate validity
    of the test, its reliability as measured in this study, particularly for the first
    time users, is relatively low. Familiarity with similar tests, however, improves
    its reliability.

  abstract: 'Background: Innovative low-cost sustainable strategies are required to
    reduce the high prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia in developing countries.
    methods  We undertook a community-based randomized controlled intervention trial
    to assess the effects of cooking in iron or aluminium cooking pots in Malawian
    households in an area with high malaria prevalence. Analysis was by intention
    to treat and consistency of use. The primary outcomes were change in haemoglobin
    and iron status. Findings: The study population comprised 164 participants eating
    from aluminium cooking pots and 158 from iron cooking pots. The mean haemoglobin
    change was significantly increased after 6 weeks in adults who consistently ate
    from an iron cooking pot (+3.6 g/l compared to −3.2 g/l, mean difference between
    groups 6.8 g/l, 95% CI +0.86, +12.74). In children, no significant haemoglobin
    change was observed in consistent pot users, although they showed a significant
    reduction in iron deficiency (iron 8.6 ZP/g and aluminium 10.8 ZP/g, mean difference
    2.2 ZP/g, 95% CI +1.08, +3.32). Interpretation: Rural Malawian adults in a high
    malaria transmission area who consistently consume food prepared in iron cooking
    pots show a significant rise in haemoglobin after 6 weeks use. Children showed
    a reduction in iron deficiency, but no significant improvement in haemoglobin,
    possibly because of their high malaria parasite prevalence. Using iron cooking
    pots in developing countries could provide an innovative way to prevent iron deficiency
    and anaemia in malarious areas where regular iron supplementation is problematic.'

    are likely contributing factors behind the widely debated replication crisis of
    psychology, cognitive neuroscience and biomedical science in general. We review
    these shortcomings and suggest that, after about 60 years of negative experience,
    NHST should no longer be the default, dominant statistical practice of all biomedical
    and psychological research. Different inferential methods (NHST, likelihood estimation,
    Bayesian methods, false-discovery rate control) may be most suitable for different
    types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify
    its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including
    negative findings. Studies should optimally be pre-registered and raw data published.
    The current statistics lite educational approach for students that has sustained
    the widespread, spurious use of NHST should be phased out. Instead, we should
    encourage either more in-depth statistical training of more researchers and/or
    more widespread involvement of professional statisticians in all research.

  title: Motives for Filing a False Allegation of Rape
  container-title: Archives of Sexual Behavior
  page: '1-8'
  abstract: 'The list of motives by Kanin (1994) is the most cited list of motives
    to file a false allegation of rape. Kanin posited that complainants file a false
    allegation out of revenge, to produce an alibi or to get sympathy. A new list
    of motives is proposed in which gain is the predominant factor. In the proposed
    list, complainants file a false allegation out of material gain, emotional gain,
    or a disturbed mental state. The list can be subdivided into eight different categories:
    material gain, alibi, revenge, sympathy, attention, a disturbed mental state,
    relabeling, or regret. To test the validity of the list, a sample of 57 proven
    false allegations were studied at and provided by the National Unit of the Dutch
    National Police (NU). The complete files were studied to ensure correct classification
    by the NU and to identify the motives of the complainants. The results support
    the overall validity of the list. Complainants were primarily motivated by emotional
    gain. Most false allegations were used to cover up other behavior such as adultery
    or skipping school. Some complainants, however, reported more than one motive.
    A large proportion, 20% of complainants, said that they did not know why they
    filed a false allegation. The results confirm the complexity of motivations for
    filing false allegations and the difficulties associated with archival studies.
    In conclusion, the list of Kanin is, based on the current results, valid but insufficient
    to explain all the different motives of complainants to file a false allegation.'

  title: Impacts of Neanderthal-Introgressed Sequences on the Landscape of Human Gene
    Expression
  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '916-927'
  volume: '168'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Regulatory variation influencing gene expression is a key contributor
    to phenotypic diversity, both within and between species. Unfortunately, RNA degrades
    too rapidly to be recovered from fossil remains, limiting functional genomic insights
    about our extinct hominin relatives. Many Neanderthal sequences survive in modern
    humans due to ancient hybridization, providing an opportunity to assess their
    contributions to transcriptional variation and to test hypotheses about regulatory
    evolution. We developed a flexible Bayesian statistical approach to quantify allele-specific
    expression (ASE) in complex RNA-seq datasets. We identified widespread expression
    differences between Neanderthal and modern human alleles, indicating pervasive
    cis-regulatory impacts of introgression. Brain regions and testes exhibited significant
    downregulation of Neanderthal alleles relative to other tissues, consistent with
    natural selection influencing the tissue-specific regulatory landscape. Our study
    demonstrates that Neanderthal-inherited sequences are not silent remnants of ancient
    interbreeding but have measurable impacts on gene expression that contribute to
    variation in modern human phenotypes.

  title: Hunter-gatherer males are more risk-seeking than females, even in late childhood
  container-title: Evolution and Human Behavior
  abstract: Abstract Observed economic and labor disparities between the sexes may,
    in part, result from evolved sex differences in risk preferences. Using incentivized
    economic games, we report on sex differences in risk preferences in the Hadza,
    a population of hunter-gatherers. One game played in 2010 (n = 233) found that
    more Hadza males than females prefer to gamble for a chance to earn more maize
    rather than settle for a sure, but smaller, amount. Similarly, a second game played
    in 2013 (n = 102) found that male Hadza gamble a greater proportion of honey for
    a chance to earn more compared to female Hadza. Effect sizes are small to medium.
    We find weak evidence that risk-taking increases in men as their mating opportunities
    increase. In both games, the sex difference widens throughout childhood and is
    greatest among adolescents; though note that child samples are small. We explore
    developmental trends further using observational data on food returns in children
    (n = 357). Our data suggest that while the mean number of calories boys bring
    to camp remains stable with age, the variance in their caloric returns increases.
    Among girls, the variance remains stable with increased age. Both the economic
    games and food return data are consistent with the sexual division of labor wherein
    boys, beginning in late childhood, begin to target riskier foods. To the extent
    that the Hadza allow us to make inferences about long-standing patterns of human
    behavior, we suggest that sex differences in risk preferences may have been present
    long before agriculture and the modern work environment.

  abstract: 'A lack of political diversity in psychology is said to lead to a number
    of pernicious outcomes, including biased research and active discrimination against
    conservatives. We surveyed a large number (combined N = 800) of social and personality
    psychologists and discovered several interesting facts. First, although only 6%
    described themselves as conservative “overall,” there was more diversity of political
    opinion on economic issues and foreign policy. Second, respondents significantly
    underestimated the proportion of conservatives among their colleagues. Third,
    conservatives fear negative consequences of revealing their political beliefs
    to their colleagues. Finally, they are right to do so: In decisions ranging from
    paper reviews to hiring, many social and personality psychologists said that they
    would discriminate against openly conservative colleagues. The more liberal respondents
    were, the more they said they would discriminate.'

  title: 'Sex Differences In The Adult Human Brain: Evidence From 5,216 UK Biobank
    Participants'
  container-title: bioRxiv
  abstract: Sex differences in human brain structure and function are of substantial
    scientific interest because of sex-differential susceptibility to psychiatric
    disorders and because of the potential to explain sex differences in psychological
    traits. Males are known to have larger brain volumes, though the patterns of differences
    across brain subregions have typically only been examined in small, inconsistent
    studies. In addition, despite common findings of greater male variability in traits
    like intelligence, personality, and physical performance, variance differences
    in the brain have received little attention. Here we report the largest single-sample
    study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain to date
    (2,750 female and 2,466 male participants aged 44-77 years). Males had higher
    cortical and sub-cortical volumes, cortical surface areas, and white matter diffusion
    directionality; females had thicker cortices and higher white matter tract complexity.
    Considerable overlap between the distributions for males and females was common,
    and subregional differences were smaller after accounting for global differences.
    There was generally greater male variance across structural measures. The modestly
    higher male score on two cognitive tests was partly mediated via structural differences.
    Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal
    sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode
    network. This large-scale characterisation of neurobiological sex differences
    provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes of sex differences
    in brain structure and function, and their associated psychological and psychiatric
    consequences.

  container-title: Journal of Communication
  publisher: Wiley Subscription Services, Inc.
  page: '1-22'
  volume: '65'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: This article presents 2 studies of the association of media violence rates
    with societal violence rates. In the first study, movie violence and homicide
    rates are examined across the 20th century and into the 21st (1920–2005). Throughout
    the mid-20th century small-to-moderate correlational relationships can be observed
    between movie violence and homicide rates in the United States. This trend reversed
    in the early and latter 20th century, with movie violence rates inversely related
    to homicide rates. In the second study, videogame violence consumption is examined
    against youth violence rates in the previous 2 decades. Videogame consumption
    is associated with a decline in youth violence rates. Results suggest that societal
    consumption of media violence is not predictive of increased societal violence
    rates.

  title: Does Sexy Media Promote Teen Sex? A Meta-Analytic and Methodological Review
  container-title: Psychiatric Quarterly
  page: '1-10'
  abstract: Parents and policy makers are often concerned that sexy media (media depicting
    or discussing sexual encounters) may promote sexual behavior in young viewers.
    There has been some debate among scholars regarding whether such media promote
    sexual behaviors. It remains unclear to what extent sexy media is a risk factor
    for increased sexual behavior among youth. The current study employed a meta-analysis
    of 22 correlational and longitudinal studies of sexy media effects on teen sexual
    behavior (n = 22,172). Moderator analyses examined methodological and science
    culture issues such as citation bias. Results indicated the presence only of very
    weak effects. General media use did not correlate with sexual behaviors (r = 0.005),
    and sexy media use correlated only weakly with sexual behaviors (r = 0.082) once
    other factors had been controlled. Higher effects were seen for studies with citation
    bias, and lower effects when family environment is controlled. The impact of media
    on teen sexuality was minimal with effect sizes near to zero.

  title: The weak-lensing masses of filaments between luminous red galaxies
  container-title: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
  page: '2605-2613'
  volume: '468'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In the standard model of non-linear structure formation, a cosmic web
    of dark-matter-dominated filaments connects dark matter haloes. In this paper,
    we stack the weak lensing signal of an ensemble of filaments between groups and
    clusters of galaxies. Specifically, we detect the weak lensing signal, using CFHTLenS
    galaxy ellipticities, from stacked filaments between Sloan Digital Sky Survey
    (SDSS)-III/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey luminous red galaxies (LRGs).
    As a control, we compare the physical LRG pairs with projected LRG pairs that
    are more widely separated in redshift space. We detect the excess filament mass
    density in the projected pairs at the 5$\sigma$ level, finding a mass of (1.6
    0.3)  1013 M⊙ for a stacked filament region 7.1 h−1 Mpc long and 2.5 h−1 Mpc wide.
    This filament signal is compared with a model based on the three-point galaxy–galaxy-convergence
    correlation function, as developed in Clampitt et al., yielding reasonable agreement.

  title: Microaggressions
  container-title: Perspectives on Psychological Science
  publisher: SAGE Publications
  page: '138-169'
  volume: '12'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The microaggression concept has recently galvanized public discussion
    and spread to numerous college campuses and businesses. I argue that the microaggression
    research program (MRP) rests on five core premises, namely, that microaggressions
    (1) are operationalized with sufficient clarity and consensus to afford rigorous
    scientific investigation; (2) are interpreted negatively by most or all minority
    group members; (3) reflect implicitly prejudicial and implicitly aggressive motives;
    (4) can be validly assessed using only respondents? subjective reports; and (5)
    exert an adverse impact on recipients? mental health. A review of the literature
    reveals negligible support for all five suppositions. More broadly, the MRP has
    been marked by an absence of connectivity to key domains of psychological science,
    including psychometrics, social cognition, cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavior
    genetics, and personality, health, and industrial-organizational psychology. Although
    the MRP has been fruitful in drawing the field?s attention to subtle forms of
    prejudice, it is far too underdeveloped on the conceptual and methodological fronts
    to warrant real-world application. I conclude with 18 suggestions for advancing
    the scientific status of the MRP, recommend abandonment of the term ?microaggression,?
    and call for a moratorium on microaggression training programs and publicly distributed
    microaggression lists pending research to address the MRP?s scientific limitations.

  title: Autism occurrence by mmr vaccine status among us children with older siblings
    with and without autism
  container-title: JAMA
  page: '1534-1540'
  volume: '313'
  issue: '15'
  abstract: Importance  Despite research showing no link between the measles-mumps-rubella
    (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), beliefs that the vaccine causes
    autism persist, leading to lower vaccination levels. Parents who already have
    a child with ASD may be especially wary of vaccinations. Objective  To report ASD
    occurrence by MMR vaccine status in a large sample of US children who have older
    siblings with and without ASD.Design, Setting, and Participants  A retrospective
    cohort study using an administrative claims database associated with a large commercial
    health plan. Participants included children continuously enrolled in the health
    plan from birth to at least 5 years of age during 2001-2012 who also had an older
    sibling continuously enrolled for at least 6 months between 1997 and 2012.Exposures
    MMR vaccine receipt (0, 1, 2 doses) after 1 year of age.Main Outcomes and Measures
    ASD status defined as 2 claims with a diagnosis code in any position for autistic
    disorder or other specified pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) including Asperger
    syndrome, or unspecified PDD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
    Revision, Clinical Modification 299.0x, 299.8x, 299.9x).Results  Of 95 727 children
    with older siblings, 994 (1.04%) were diagnosed with ASD and 1929 (2.02%) had
    an older sibling with ASD. Of those with older siblings with ASD, 134 (6.9%) had
    ASD, vs 860 (0.9%) children with unaffected siblings (P<.001). MMR vaccination
    rates (≥1 dose) were 84% (n=78 549) at age 2 years and 92% (n=86 063) at age 5
    years for children with unaffected older siblings, vs 73% (n=1409) at age 2 years
    and 86% (n=1660) at age 5 years for children with affected siblings. MMR vaccine
    receipt was not associated with an increased risk of ASD at any age. For children
    with older siblings with ASD, at age 2, the adjusted relative risk (RR) of ASD
    for 1 dose of MMR vaccine vs no vaccine was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.48-1.22; P=.25), and
    at age 5, the RR of ASD for 2 doses compared with no vaccine was 0.56 (95% CI,
    0.30-1.04; P=.07). For children whose older siblings did not have ASD, at age
    2, the adjusted RR of ASD for 1 dose was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.68-1.20; P=.50) and at
    age 5, the RR of ASD for 2 doses was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.76-1.54; P=.65).Conclusions
    and Relevance  In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings,
    receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless
    of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association
    between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk
    for ASD.

  container-title: 'Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and
    Engineering Science'
  volume: '470'
  issue: '2163'
  abstract: If a chain is initially at rest in a beaker at a height h1 above the ground,
    and the end of the chain is pulled over the rim of the beaker and down towards
    the ground and then released, the chain will spontaneously ‘flow’ out of the beaker
    under gravity. Furthermore, the beads do not simply drag over the edge of the
    beaker but form a fountain reaching a height h2 above it. We show that the formation
    of a fountain requires that the beads come into motion not only by being pulled
    upwards by the part of the chain immediately above the pile, but also by being
    pushed upwards by an anomalous reaction force from the pile of stationary chain.
    We propose possible origins for this force, argue that its magnitude will be proportional
    to the square of the chain velocity and predict and verify experimentally that
    h2∝h1.

  chapter-number: Popularity as a Poor Proxy for Utility
  abstract: Scholarly discussions of prejudice fail to agree on how implicit prejudice
    connects to other forms of prejudice; it is unclear whether different measures
    of implicit prejudice measure the same thing; the meaning of “implicit” in the
    phrase “implicit prejudice” is contested; and implicit measures of prejudice are
    no better at predicting behavior, even “microaggression”, than are traditional
    explicit measures of prejudice. The attention paid to the implicit prejudice construct
    illustrates how success in social science can depend less on theoretical clarity
    or predictive success and on how skillfully like-minded researchers can use a
    paradigm to generate statistically significant but substantively insignificant
    results that they can then package into sound bites that support a particular
    worldview or political agenda. This chapter discusses several reasons why the
    implicit prejudice construct is in need of renovation, why the implicit prejudice
    meme should be retired, and why it is so difficult to combat politically seductive
    ideas within social psychology.

  title: 'Sex differences in visual-spatial working memory: A meta-analysis'
  container-title: Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
  page: '307-334'
  volume: '24'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Visual-spatial working memory measures are widely used in clinical and
    experimental settings. Furthermore, it has been argued that the male advantage
    in spatial abilities can be explained by a sex difference in visual-spatial working
    memory. Therefore, sex differences in visual-spatial working memory have important
    implication for research, theory, and practice, but they have yet to be quantified.
    The present meta-analysis quantified the magnitude of sex differences in visual-spatial
    working memory and examined variables that might moderate them. The analysis used
    a set of 180 effect sizes from healthy males and females drawn from 98 samples
    ranging in mean age from 3 to 86 years. Multilevel meta-analysis was used on the
    overall data set to account for non-independent effect sizes. The data also were
    analyzed in separate task subgroups by means of multilevel and mixed-effects models.
    Results showed a small but significant male advantage (mean d = 0.155, 95 % confidence
    interval = 0.087-0.223). All the tasks produced a male advantage, except for memory
    for location, where a female advantage emerged. Age of the participants was a
    significant moderator, indicating that sex differences in visual-spatial working
    memory appeared first in the 13-17 years age group. Removing memory for location
    tasks from the sample affected the pattern of significant moderators. The present
    results indicate a male advantage in visual-spatial working memory, although age
    and specific task modulate the magnitude and direction of the effects. Implications
    for clinical applications, cognitive model building, and experimental research
    are discussed.

  abstract: AbstractPurpose Previous studies on police use of fatal force in the United
    States are limited to specific cities or rely on aggregate data. This is the first
    analysis of its type to rely on incident-level national data and to establish
    base rates for police shooting fatalities. Methods Publicly available data from
    the Washington Post were used to model the data, which cover the period from January
    2, 2015 to December 29, 2016 (n = 1948). Results Although the data are limited,
    the patterns are not consistent with the national rhetoric that the police are
    killing Blacks, particularly unarmed Black men, more than others because of their
    race and that officer-involved shooting fatalities are increasing; fatalities
    are generally stable across both years. The data help establish national base
    rates for fatal police shootings, which has yet to be done. Conclusions The United
    States government should develop a nationwide use of force database to assist
    police executives, elected leaders and researchers in understanding police use
    of force. Future research should rely on the situational context of the shooting
    and the micro-level factors the courts consider when analyzing the legal aspects
    of use of force instead of sociodemographic factors.

  abstract: 'To achieve a balanced gene expression dosage between males (XY) and females (XX), mammals have evolved a compensatory mechanism to randomly inactivate one of the female X chromosomes. Despite this chromosome-wide silencing, a number of genes escape X inactivation: in women about 15% of X-linked genes are bi-allelically expressed and in mice, about 3%. Expression from the inactive X allele varies from a few percent of that from the active allele to near equal expression. While most genes have a stable inactivation pattern, a subset of genes exhibit tissue-specific differences in escape from X inactivation. Escape genes appear to be protected from the repressive chromatin modifications associated with X inactivation. Differences in the identity and distribution of escape genes between species and tissues suggest a role for these genes in the evolution of sex differences in specific phenotypes. The higher expression of escape genes in females than in males implies that they may have female-specific roles and may be responsible for some of the phenotypes observed in X aneuploidy.'

  title: The conceptual penis as a social construct
  container-title: Cogent Social Sciences
  publisher: Cogent
  volume: '3'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Anatomical penises may exist, but as pre-operative transgendered women
    also have anatomical penises, the penis vis-à-vis maleness is an incoherent construct.
    We argue that the conceptual penis is better understood not as an anatomical organ
    but as a social construct isomorphic to performative toxic masculinity. Through
    detailed poststructuralist discursive criticism and the example of climate change,
    this paper will challenge the prevailing and damaging social trope that penises
    are best understood as the male sexual organ and reassign it a more fitting role
    as a type of masculine performance.

  abstract: 'Analýza komplexně a v souvislostech představuje problémy, které se v oblasti určování a vymáhání výživného vyskytují. Předně se zabývá aktuální právní (1) úpravou určování výživného, od zjišťování příjmů a majetkových poměrů povinného, určování odůvodněných potřeb dítěte, až po samotné vyměření konkrétní částky výživného. Dále předestírá (2) problémy, které se vyskytují v procesu určování výživného, ať už před soudy, nebo při rozhodování rodičů o mimosoudní dohodě o výživném. V neposlední řadě materiál podrobně referuje o (3) vymáhání výživného, respektive o stávajících i možných řešeních stavu, kdy (určené) výživné není plněno (zejména exekuce). Ve vztahu k procesní rovině rozhodování o výživném se analýza taktéž věnuje popisu možných nelegislativních přístupů upřednostňujících smírný průběh procesu (např. německá Cochemská praxe). Nejsou však opomenuty ani další často diskutované otázky jako role doporučujících tabulek, práce se statistikami o výživném, úroky z prodlení dlužníka výživného, dovolání ve věcech výživného, postoupení pohledávek výživného, interdisciplinární vzdělávání pracovníků justice, trestní postih neplatičů nebo tzv. zálohové výživné.'
